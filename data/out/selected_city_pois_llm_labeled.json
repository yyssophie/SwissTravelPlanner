    "description": "In the first half of the 16th century, the Grossmünster served as the starting point of the Reformation under Huldrych Zwingli and Heinrich Bullinger. The characteristic tops of its neo-Gothic towers were added by Johann Caspar Voegeli and John Hagge Mille from 1781 to 1787. Between 1913 and 1915 the interior renovations were completed by Gustav Gull and Hermann Fietz.\n\nParticularly worth seeing are the glass windows by Sigmar Polke, the Romanesque crypt, the Romanesque capitals in the church and cloister, the stained glass windows by Augusto Giacometti (1932), the bronze doors by Otto Münch (1935 and 1950), and the Reformation museum in the cloister. Guided tours are available.\n\nThe so-called Karlsturm is one of the two Grossmünster towers of this famous Zurich landmark. 187 stairs lead from the nave up to the tower vantage point – from where visitors have bird’s-eye views over the Zurich rooftops [https://www.myswitzerland.com/en/experiences/zurichs-old-town/]and lake [https://www.myswitzerland.com/en/destinations/lake-zurich/]as well as majestic Alpine summits on the horizon.",

With the opening of the Zurich Tonhalle in 1895, the orchestra was given a hall whose acoustics are rated among the best in the world. The magnificent hall was inaugurated in the presence of Johannes Brahms. Top-class conductors have helped to turn the Tonhalle Orchestra into what it is today, with a series of CD recordings of works by Richard Strauss, Robert Schumann and Gustav Mahler that document its rise to prominence. The seminal complete recording of Beethoven's symphonies in the late 1990s won the “German Record Critics' Award” and caused a sensation in the music world. \n\nIn recent years, the Zurich Tonhalle Orchestra has emerged as one of Europe's leading ensembles. Its highly motivated musicians present approximately 100 public concerts each season, with about 50 different programmes. Since the 2019/2020 season, the Estonian conductor Paavo Järvi has been Music Director of the orchestra, whose family concerts bring joy to young listeners. Designed for twenty-somethings, tonhalleLATE is a series of exceptional events combining a classical concert with a party including electronic music.\n\nAlthough the Tonhalle is home to the Tonhalle Orchestra, the grand hall is also used by many other orchestras keen to demonstrate their skill in this wonderful setting with its magnificent acoustics.",

The route has not changed at all since it first came into service in 1889, and is a historic monument to late 19th century engineering.\n\nSaved from closure at the last minute by a Swiss bank in 1976, the historic Polybahn was completely overhauled in 1996 and equipped with state-of-the-art technology, and in 2001 the upper station was repainted in its original Sienna red colour. Thanks to this complete overhaul, the Student Express, also affectionately known as the “Polybähnli”, will continue to transport future generations from Central to Zurich’s seats of learning and back.\n\nHow to get there: Walk from Zurich main station, crossing the Limmat to Central, then take the funicular to the Polyterrasse.\n\n\nAltitude: 452 metres \nHow to get there: \nWalk from Zurich main station, crossing the Limmat to Central, then take the funicular to the Polyterrasse \nViews: Across the city and Lake Zurich to the Glärnisch, Tödi, Clariden, the Albis chain and the Uetliberg \nAttractions: The funicular itself, which carries over two million people every year \nFood and drink: Speciality restaurants in nearby Niederdorf \nAccommodation: Zurich city (the Hotel Limmathof is right next to the lower station of the Polybahn) \nWinter: Runs all year round \nSpecial comments: No service on Sundays",

To keep pace with passenger demand at the start of the last century, two large paddle steamers were then ordered: the sister vessels “Stadt Zürich” (built in 1909) and “Stadt Rapperswil” (built in 1914). Together with the “Helvetia” (built in 1875, the largest paddle steamer on Lake Zurich), the three boats formed the backbone of the Zurich fleet for many decades. \n\nToday, the Lake Zurich fleet comprises 17 boats: 15 motor vessels including three Limmat boats and the two remaining paddle steamers. The “Helvetia” left service in 1958, having covered a total of 200,000km. In March 2007, the 700-passenger ship \"Panta Rhei\" joined the fleet.",

Shady trees and areas with lots of space on which to play or relax, such as the Blatterwiese, invite you to stop and linger awhile.\n\nFollowing on from the “Expo 64” in Lausanne, the “Heureka” sculpture by Jean Tinguely was given a new home on the Zürichhorn, ultimately becoming a striking new part of the lakeside promenade.\n\nThe Chinese Garden was a gift from the city’s Chinese sister city of Kunming in thanks for the technical and scientific support provided for the expansion of the drinking water supply and urban drainage in Kunming. It is classed as a temple garden and is one of the highest-ranking gardens outside of China.",

Time seems to have stood still here many years ago, while heavy wooden beams and solid stone walls take guests on a journey into the past. In the historic rooms, only the steady ticking of the medieval mechanism accompanies visitors through history.\n\nAlso part of the tour: the ascent to the viewing platform. A wonderful panoramic view over the alleyways and rooftops of the old town and the green surroundings awaits.\n\nFurther information and booking:Zytglogge tour [http://www.bern.com/en/detail/berns-clock-tower-zytglogge]",

    "abstract": "Begun in 1421, Bern's Cathedral took 150 years to complete, and was erected entirely by volunteers. The cathedral was built for the purpose of housing a bishop, but Protestantism reached Bern before its bishop did. The cathedral represents the last major work of late Gothic architecture in Europe.",
    "description": "The interior architecture of the Münster attests to the cathedral's construction during the city's conversion from Catholicism to Protestantism. The choir's religious symbols are strongly Catholic; coats of arms on the ceiling's keystones come from Protestant times; empty statuary niches reveal religious artworks that were removed and destroyed at the transition. Other notable design elements include unusual black ceiling flourishes, added after the Gothic had gone out of fashion; the massive granite altar taken from Lausanne Cathedral; and the 15th-century Last Judgment sculpture over the main portal. Protestant church leaders left the carving intact because of its justice theme. 234 human figures, from high and low ranks, religious leaders including the pope and lay people, are represented. Some of each group head to heaven, and some to hell.",

    "abstract": "A visit to Bern in December is particularly magical thanks to the many Christmas markets and pop-ups. The numerous Advent experiences are within walking distance in Bern's UNESCO-listed Old Town. And many villages around Bern also offer enchanting markets and experiences during the Advent season.",
    "description": "During the Advent season, the scent of gingerbread, roasted almonds and mulled wine wafts through the festively decorated streets of Bern's old town. If you follow them, you will find great Christmas markets and pop-ups in various squares. From traditional to artisanal to a paradise for foodies: Each Christmas market impresses with its very own character. \n\nThe UNESCO World Heritage Site with its old town houses dating from the 15th to 17th centuries and Bern Minster - the highest church tower in Switzerland - provides a fantastic and unique backdrop. Even away from the markets, a Christmas shopping spree is a special experience thanks to the 6 kilometers of arcades and the typical Bernese vaulted cellars. \n\nFor those who like a picture-book Christmas, we recommend a trip to other parts of the Bern region. From the romantic Christmas market in Huttwil and the lovingly decorated chalets at the Kambly Experience to what is probably the largest nativity scene in the Central Plateau - Christmas lovers can also experience wonderful atmospheres in the Gantrisch Nature Park, the Emmental, Oberaargau and Laupen.\n\n [https://www.bern.com/de/weihnachten]More information: Christmas in Bern [www.bern.com/weihnachten]",

    "description": "Whether on your own or under the guidance of professional guides, you decide how you want to discover this unique Swiss river. The Aareböötle is enjoyed by thousands of locals and tourists alike every year and what could be better than spending the day on the river and arriving in the capital city of Bern. The most famous stretch is the one from Thun (Uttigen) to Bern, where you arrive either at Camping Eichholz in Wabern or directly at the Marzili swimming pool below the Parliament House.\n\nOn a hot summer's day, you can see hundreds of boats, tubes, SUPs and kayaks floating down the river. If that's all too much for you, the much quieter section of the river from Worblaufen to Wohlensee is just as beautiful, only with far fewer visitors. And for the more adventurous among you who like to be alone on the water, the river goes much further, all the way to Solothurn and beyond.\n\nWherever and however you want to experience the Aare, make sure you have the right equipment with you: a good, solid boat, a life jacket, paddle, repair kit and sun protection. The regulations for lifejackets are complex and each type of boat requires a different type of lifejacket, so make sure you have the right one. To enjoy the Aare in the safest way possible, contact one of the professional rental and activity companies who will provide you with the best possible equipment and guidance. You pick up your equipment, get a good briefing and return the equipment to Bern at the end of the tour. Simple.\n\nMore information here [https://www.aareschlauchboot.ch/aare-boat-rental].",

    "description": "Hiking across the imposing Aletsch Glacier is always an unforgettable experience. Surrounded by the most famous 4,000m peaks of the Bernese and Valais Alps, passing imposing crevasses and enjoying a breathtaking view of the immense alpine glaciers.\n\nThis unique adventure begins as soon as we collect you from the meeting point and accompany you on the journey by gondola lift and train to the Jungfraujoch. The Jungfraujoch is located on the main European water divide (Rhône/Rhine) at 3,454m above sea level, making this the highest train station in Europe.\nOnce you are roped up and equipped with a climbing harness and a ski pole, our IFMGA mountain guides will skillfully guide you across the glacier.\n\nAs we hike across the glacier, our guides will explain how we promote sustainability and the importance of preserving the alpine glacial region.\nOne of our focal points is climate change, one of the main causes of glacier melt. You will learn how climate change affects the glaciers, the impact this has on the ecosystem and the water cycle, and the importance of taking steps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to slow down glacier retreat.\n\nThe walking distance and the speed of our progress on the glacier can be individually adapted to the needs of your group. After a break, you will visit the majestic Jungfraujoch under the watchful eye of your OUTDOOR guides. Visitors cannot fail to be impressed by this extensive and striking complex, planned and subsequently built in true pioneering spirit at the end of the 19th century.\nThe Jungfraujoch building is a prime example of sustainable planning and construction. The pioneering construction and the maintenance of the facility are perfect examples of sustainable building and the careful handling of sensitive alpine areas.\n\nWe visit the highest vantage point on the Jungfraujoch, the “Sphinx”, the Ice Palace with its examples of ice art, the glacier plateau and follow the “Alpine Sensation” tour, which provides us with musical accompaniment and interesting information about the planning and construction work on the Jungfraujoch. Along the way, you will learn key facts about the construction and maintenance of the Jungfraujoch and the ways in which it benefits science and the tourism industry.\n\nThis group activity on the glacier promotes team building, addresses the importance of preserving the alpine region, raises awareness and motivates visitors to make the long-term sacrifices needed to secure the future of the glaciers.",

    "description": "SEAMLESS TRAVEL EXPERIENCE\nThe GoldenPass Express provides a seamless and even more comfortable travel experience on one of Switzerland’s most picturesque train routes. The panoramic train will connect Interlaken with Montreux up to four times a day, offering uninterrupted views of the breathtaking panorama.PRESTIGE\nThe travel class “Prestige” is the centrepiece of the train. It offers everything you would expect from an unforgettable train journey: plenty of privacy, maximum comfort in a small compartment, and an exceptional culinary offering.\n\nMake yourself comfortable on the luxurious and heated leather seats, which can be rotated 180 degrees upon request. The travel class is also elevated by 40 cm compared to the other travel classes, offering you an even better view of the fascinating scenery.\n\nCULINARY DELIGHTS ON THE GOLDENPASS EXPRESS\nLocal and international delicacies can be ordered in advance, ensuring a perfect start to an exciting journey. For example, how about a glass of champagne and a portion of the finest caviar from Frutigen in Switzerland?\n\nIf you prefer to pamper your palate with regional delicacies, you won’t be disappointed with a traditional apéro-plate or a vegetarian alternative. While champagne and caviar are served exclusively in “Prestige” and 1st class, you can enjoy selected dishes from the small but exquisite menu in all travel classes.\n\nWORLD-FAMOUS PLACES, THREE REGIONS\nThe journey on the GoldenPass Express is like a foray through Switzerland. The trip starts in picturesque Interlaken and continues via Gstaad, Château-d’Oex and Montbovon to Montreux, the journey’s final stop. Of course, you can also start your trip in Montreux.\n\nInterlaken is a great base for numerous activities and boasts incredible views of Eiger, Mönch and Jungfrau. Luxurious Gstaad is known for its charming chalets and is a favourite holiday spot among stars and winter sports enthusiasts alike. Château-d’Oex is known for its hot air balloons and, with a little luck, you might spot one aloft. Montreux, of course, is home to the annual Montreux Jazz Festival [https://www.montreuxjazzfestival.com/en/].\n\n\nSWISSNESS\nThe GoldenPass Express is a world-first and a Swiss masterstroke. After all, the idea of connecting Interlaken and Montreux without needing to change trains originated more than 100 years ago. The project never materialised, however, because of the different track gauges of the respective sections of the line. But this seemingly impossible challenge could now be solved by an ingenious invention: adjustable bogies.\nGOLDENPASS EXPRESS TIMETABLE\n\n\nThe current timetable as well as additional information can be found here [https://www.gpx.swiss/en/pages/timetable].\n\n\nRESERVATIONS AND SURCHARGES\nDue to limited seating capacity, reservations are mandatory in “Prestige” (CHF 49) and strongly recommended for 1st and 2nd class travel. This is in addition to a valid ticket for the selected travel class.\n\nThe only thing you might find disappointing? The entire trip lasts just 3 hours 15 minutes. With those stunning views and unrivalled comfort, the journey is just as spectacular as the destination.\n\n\nSWISS TRAVEL PASS\nThis route is fully included in the Swiss Travel Pass (Flex) / GA Travelcard, though seat reservations must be paid for separately. \nBook tickets [https://www.myswitzerland.com/en/planning/transport-accommodation/tickets-public-transport/]",

The cable car can accommodate 100 persons on each ride. At the same time it can carry 6,000 kilograms of freight. The ride takes 4 minutes. \n\nFrom Grütschalp to Mürren \nAn adhesion railway runs on the romantic stretch across alpine meadows to Mürren. This ride traverses an additional 147 meters. \n\nMürren is not accessible by car. For this reason freight transport is especially important. Transportation is carried out by means of containers, which are transferred to the freight compartment of the adhesion train at the intermediate station’s ultra-modern loading facility. \n\nThe Lauterbrunnen-Mürren mountain train was opened in 1891. There is an additional means of traveling to Mürren: by aerial cable car from Stechelberg (the aerial cable car continues onward via Gimmelwald to Schilthorn).",

No wonder that this is the source of Switzerland’s Grand Crus in wine. \n\nTake to the train, your bicycle or even walk to discover the 800 hectares of terraced vineyards of the Lavaux that have been accorded UNESCO World-Heritage listing. A footpath of 32 km in length leads from Lausanne-Ouchy to Chillon Castle. En route you'll find 7 circuits complete with information panels detailing every facet of local viticulture. Taste locally produced wines in an authentic wine cellar and learns more about local wine growing culture and grape varieties.FROM VINE TO WINE IN LAVAUX\nAssist a Lavaux winemaker in his daily work and enjoy an authentic experience of man and vine. This half-day of discovery includes working in the vineyard or the cellar (depending on the season), visiting the estate, wine tasting with a snack and a bottle of wine to take home as a souvenir. All reservations must, if possible, be made at least one week in advance.\nDuration: 3h\nNumber of participants: 2-10\nLanguages: German, English, French\n\nMore information [https://www.region-du-leman.ch/en/Z9278/lavaux-unesco-terraced-vineyards?utm_campaign=dieschweizelektrisiert&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=myswitzerand&utm_content=de&utm_term=lavaux]",

    "description": "SEAMLESS TRAVEL EXPERIENCE\nThe GoldenPass Express provides a seamless and even more comfortable travel experience on one of Switzerland’s most picturesque train routes. The panoramic train will connect Interlaken with Montreux up to four times a day, offering uninterrupted views of the breathtaking panorama.PRESTIGE\nThe travel class “Prestige” is the centrepiece of the train. It offers everything you would expect from an unforgettable train journey: plenty of privacy, maximum comfort in a small compartment, and an exceptional culinary offering.\n\nMake yourself comfortable on the luxurious and heated leather seats, which can be rotated 180 degrees upon request. The travel class is also elevated by 40 cm compared to the other travel classes, offering you an even better view of the fascinating scenery.\n\nCULINARY DELIGHTS ON THE GOLDENPASS EXPRESS\nLocal and international delicacies can be ordered in advance, ensuring a perfect start to an exciting journey. For example, how about a glass of champagne and a portion of the finest caviar from Frutigen in Switzerland?\n\nIf you prefer to pamper your palate with regional delicacies, you won’t be disappointed with a traditional apéro-plate or a vegetarian alternative. While champagne and caviar are served exclusively in “Prestige” and 1st class, you can enjoy selected dishes from the small but exquisite menu in all travel classes.\n\nWORLD-FAMOUS PLACES, THREE REGIONS\nThe journey on the GoldenPass Express is like a foray through Switzerland. The trip starts in picturesque Interlaken and continues via Gstaad, Château-d’Oex and Montbovon to Montreux, the journey’s final stop. Of course, you can also start your trip in Montreux.\n\nInterlaken is a great base for numerous activities and boasts incredible views of Eiger, Mönch and Jungfrau. Luxurious Gstaad is known for its charming chalets and is a favourite holiday spot among stars and winter sports enthusiasts alike. Château-d’Oex is known for its hot air balloons and, with a little luck, you might spot one aloft. Montreux, of course, is home to the annual Montreux Jazz Festival [https://www.montreuxjazzfestival.com/en/].\n\n\nSWISSNESS\nThe GoldenPass Express is a world-first and a Swiss masterstroke. After all, the idea of connecting Interlaken and Montreux without needing to change trains originated more than 100 years ago. The project never materialised, however, because of the different track gauges of the respective sections of the line. But this seemingly impossible challenge could now be solved by an ingenious invention: adjustable bogies.\nGOLDENPASS EXPRESS TIMETABLE\n\n\nThe current timetable as well as additional information can be found here [https://www.gpx.swiss/en/pages/timetable].\n\n\nRESERVATIONS AND SURCHARGES\nDue to limited seating capacity, reservations are mandatory in “Prestige” (CHF 49) and strongly recommended for 1st and 2nd class travel. This is in addition to a valid ticket for the selected travel class.\n\nThe only thing you might find disappointing? The entire trip lasts just 3 hours 15 minutes. With those stunning views and unrivalled comfort, the journey is just as spectacular as the destination.\n\n\nSWISS TRAVEL PASS\nThis route is fully included in the Swiss Travel Pass (Flex) / GA Travelcard, though seat reservations must be paid for separately. \nBook tickets [https://www.myswitzerland.com/en/planning/transport-accommodation/tickets-public-transport/]",

From there, the ultra-modern cable car carries passengers up the steep 723-metre climb to the Ebenalp (1,644 metres above sea level) in just six minutes.\n\nFrom the upper station, the path leads down through the prehistoric Wildkirchli caves, which were inhabited around 40,000 years ago, then on to the hermit’s dwelling and the famous Berggasthaus Aescher mountain inn. Prehistoric stone tools were found in the area 100 years ago, evidence that the area was inhabited by hunter-gatherers during the Palaeolithic era (45,000 – 30,000 BC). The remains of cave bears were also found alongside the stone tools.\n\nThe Ebenalp is the ideal starting point for numerous easy to challenging hikes in the Alpstein massif. Taking in fragrant alpine meadows, impressive rock formations and magnificent lookout points, the hikes showcase the very best of the Appenzell region.INFORMATION\nAltitude: 1,640 metres \nHow to get there: Train to Appenzell and on to Wasserauen, cable car to the Ebenalp.\nViews: To the Seealp and Meglisalp, Säntis, Altmann and Hoher Kasten, across the Appenzell region and Lake Constance to Germany and further west to the Feldberg \nAttractions: Alpine garden at the Berggasthaus Ebenalp mountain inn \nFood and drink: Hearty, home-style, Appenzell specialities \nWinter: Winter sports area with ski lifts on the Ebenalp \nSpecial comments: The secure path to the Aescher mountain inn passes through the caves\nDiscounted mountain ascent with Swiss Travel Pass/GA travelcard.\nBuy your tickets on arrival at the station.\n\n\n\nDAY TRIPS TO THE MOUNTAINS\nBuy your return rail and mountain ascent tickets now\n\nTimetable and tickets [https://www.sbb.ch/de/kaufen/pages/fahrplan/fahrplan.xhtml?&nach=Ebenalp]",

    "description": "The railway line to Wasserauen constructed at the beginning of the last century was actually the first section of a planned railway up the Säntis. The railway line never got further than the valley town, however, and so the cable car from Schwägalp to the top of the Säntis was opened in 1935. From the valley station, you glide almost weightlessly up to the imposing summit in around 10 minutes. At 2,502 metres above sea level, on clear days the mountain provides breathtaking views of France, Germany, Italy, Austria, Liechtenstein and Switzerland. \n\nThe Säntis also plays a key role in weather forecasting – a weather station was first installed on the mountain way back in 1882. An experiential world brings the impressive natural phenomena and their elementary effects to life. A second experiential world – “Säntis – the Ice World” – was opened in 2020. Visitors learn all about snow, ice, ice crystals and glaciers through a series of fun activities and displays.\n\nIn summer, numerous special experiences such as full moon trips, sunrise ascents or Säntis-Spitzegnoss evenings attract visitors to the mountain.INFORMATION\nAltitude: 2,502 m.a.s.l.\nHow to get there: Train to Urnäsch or Nesslau, PostBus to Schwägalp, cable car to the Säntis in 10 minutes\nViews: Across the Appenzell region and the Alpstein mountain range to Lake Constance, Vorarlberg, the Graubünden Alps as far as the Bernina, in particular the Churfirsten range and beyond them the Tödi, Finsteraarhorn, Pilatus and Rigi, and across the Swiss Plateau to the Jura and Black Forest \nAttractions: Identify mountains and valleys from the viewing terraces, enjoy splendid sunrises and sunsets, full moon trips, a night on the Säntis \nFood and drink: Large, modern Säntisgipfel restaurant\nAlter Säntis mountain inn (summer only) \nAccommodation: Alter Säntis mountain inn: Double and multi-bed rooms, dormitories (summer only) \nHotel Schwägalp: Double rooms and tourist dormitories \nGroups: Rooms for events at the summit and at Schwägalp (extensive event brochure available online)\nAlter Säntis has space for 90 guests (function room) \nOperating times: Säntis cable car runs all year round (brief closure for maintenance, usually in January/February, check the timetable [https://saentisbahn.ch/en/experience/cablecar/timetable/])\nSwiss Travel Pass/GA travelcard: Discounted mountain ascent with Swiss Travel Pass/GA travelcard.

After boarding, the path first leads you 450 metres upwards. Here you still have time to relax! Then it's up to you how fast you go, curve by curve, down the 1000-metre descent towards the valley. You decide the speed with the help of the brake lever.It's great fun for the entire family.\nThe bob sled run is open during summer season, weather permitting. Coming from Appenzell and going in the direction of Urnäsch, you will find Mt. Kronberg on the left-hand side.",

    "abstract": "The Whisky Trek will undoubtedly set the pulse racing of any whisky collector or connoisseur. In fact, you can now upgrade a hike in beautiful surroundings or multiple tours in the Alpstein by adding that something extra for whisky lovers.",
    "description": "Since May 2015, visitors to the Alpstein mountains in the Appenzell Alps can embark on the highest whisky trek in the world. The brainchild of the Locher brewery – famous for its Säntis Malt whisky – and the Bergwirte-Verein Alpstein (Alpstein mountain landlords’ association), the trek offers whisky-tasting like you’ve never experienced it before.Sepp Manser, landlord at the Berggasthaus Meglisalp mountain inn, came up with the idea of creating a whisky trek when he decided to serve up his own, unique version of Säntis Malt in 2012. His idea very swiftly became a reality – all 26 of the associated local mountain inns have now joined the trail, each with their very own barrel of whisky on hand for on-site tasting.Each of these barrels of whisky contains the same basic distillate, Säntis Malt made by the Locher brewery. But that’s where the similarity ends: Each of the barrels is unique, differing from the others in the type of wood used in its construction and its previous contents. The barrels are made from American, Portuguese, French or Russian oak, and were previously filled with desert wine, Merlot, Pinot noir, Sauvignon, Gamay, Zweigelt, port, sherry, rum, bourbon, damson schnapps or even beer. This diversity results in 26 totally unique flavours along the Appenzell Whisky Trek.Just seeing the barrels is an experience, not to mention the tasting of the whisky itself. As well as varying in flavour, the different whiskies each boast a different colour, with shades ranging from amber and white gold through to rose gold and deep copper.The exclusivity of the unique whiskies is upheld by ensuring that they are only available to taste in the individual mountain inn or to buy in small (1dl) or large (5dl) “one-of-a-kind” bottles, each signed personally by the “cask keeper” – the landlord.The Appenzell Whisky Trek has a brand-new attraction:\nan exclusive new trophy that you can see and even wear! If you collect all 26 whiskies on the Alpstein whisky trek, you’ll be rewarded with a new “finisher trophy” – an original Appenzell belt with a genuine silver buckle, designed by Alpine saddler Roger Dörig. This reward replaces all previous collectors’ activities.\nAs of 25 June 2021, every 100ml bottle of whisky you buy now comes with a “Fass-Bon”, or “barrel token”, which can be detached and stuck into the Whisky Trek collector’s pass. Once your pass is full, you will be rewarded with an exclusive leather belt featuring a genuine silver buckle, crafted by artisan leatherworker Roger Dörig (valued at CHF 350). You can choose the colour and length of your belt. The Whisky Trek belt buckle is only available as a Whisky Trek trophy and is not available for purchase. The campaign will run until the end of the 2023 season\nThe collector’s pass is available from participating mountain inns and from the Locher brewery’s “Brauquöll” visitors’ centre on Brauereiplatz in Appenzell. The belt can also be ordered there, or from Roger Dörig’s shop.\nOld, expired Whisky Trek coupons are no longer valid but can be exchanged for a free 100ml bottle in the “Brauquöll” centre. The centre also still sells the decorative 9-bottle wooden storage shelf, which can be used to display your collection of treasures.We hope you enjoy this true feast for the senses in the Alpstein mountains, where the whisky is as breathtakingly unique as the surrounding scenery.\n\n\nMore information:\nwww.whiskytrek.com [http://www.saentismalt.com/en/whiskytrek.html] www.alpstein.ch [http://www.alpstein.ch]INFORMATION\n\nwww.saentismalt.com [http://www.saentismalt.com/en/whiskytrek.html] www.alpstein.ch [http://www.alpstein.ch]",

Eight women of Urnäsch provide the focus in the special exhibition in the Museum of Appenzeller Traditions in Urnäsch.

    "abstract": "At the southern end of Lake Lugano is the 1,704 metre high Monte Generoso. This lofty altitude makes it without a doubt the best mountain for views in the canton of Ticino.",
    "description": "The new restaurant “Fiore di pietra” (stone flower) created by the famous architect Mario Botta stands majestically on a rugged plateau on the mountain. Its windows offer breathtaking 360° panoramic views, taking in the lakes, the city of Lugano as well as the Matterhorn and Jungfrau all the way to the Bernina Range.\n\nNostalgic journey to the summit\nA cog railway has been taking visitors up to the peak of Monte Generoso for 125 to enjoy these breathtaking views. It is about 9km long and runs along a magical stretch of mountain scenery in the Monte Generoso nature park. In addition to electric trains, nostalgic modes of transport also use this cog railway line, including the oldest steam train still in operation in Switzerland, built in 1890, and trains from the 1950s. A ride in these trains brings the time of the Belle Époque back to life.\n\nActivities on and around the mountain\nThere is much to discover on Monte Generoso: Keen hikers can explore the mountain on more than 51km of hiking trails. The Nature Trail and the Ice Pits Nevere are just two of the many hiking paths. The Ice Pits Nevere trail takes hikers to restored ice huts, which were once used to chill milk before it was churned into butter. The brave can marvel at the landscape around Monte Generoso from the air by paragliding from the top. Flights start on Monte Generoso and glide in different directions over the lakes, countryside and towns.\n\nINFORMATION\nHow to get there:\nDrive or take public transportation from Lugano to Capolago-Riva San Vitale, from there take the Monte Generoso mountain train to the top of Monte Generoso.\n\nSunset:\nIf you get a chance, don’t miss the sunset in Ticino. It’s a truly spectacular experience.\n\nFood/drink:\nThe “Fiore di pietra” gourmet restaurant and “Generoso” self-service restaurant will satisfy your hunger and thirst after a leisurely stroll or strenuous hike.\n\nFamilies:\nThe “Bear Cave” is about 30 minutes from the “Fiore di pietra” building on the Italian side of the mountain. Some 60,000 years ago, it was home to more than 800 cave bears. The cave's length is 200m, 70m of which have been made accessible to visitors. You need sturdy shoes, hiking gear and a hat to follow in the footsteps of the cave bears.\n\nPlease note:\nReduced rate mountain rail ascent with the Swiss Travel Pass / GA travelcard.\nBuy your tickets on arrival at the station.\n\nMore information about Monte Generoso [https://www.montegeneroso.ch/en]\n\n\nMOUNTAIN DAY TRIPS\nBuy your mountain rail ascent return tickets now\n\nTimetable and tickets [https://www.sbb.ch/en/buying/pages/fahrplan/fahrplan.xhtml?&nach=GenerosoVetta]",

    "description": "The Monte San Giorgio is the Swiss saurian mountain; it has gained in prominence as a transnational locality since 2010 when the UNESCO extension also took in the Italian side of the mountain. \n\nThis mountain has a truly rich inner life: rising just under 1100 metres in height, the Monte San Giorgio in the sunny south of Ticino has been a Mecca for fossil scientists since the 19th century, and a Unesco World Heritage site since 2003. Thousands of fossilised fish and marine saurians of up to six metres in length have already been unearthed here by eager palaeontologists. And for good reason: 230 to 245 million years ago, this was the site of a 100-metre-deep ocean basin. Today, at the southern end of Lake Lugano, the Monte San Giorgio rises like a pyramid – inside, filled with all manner of fossils. One can stroll through the vineyards along the southern slopes of the woody mountain, saunter through the idyllic town of Meride, or allow oneself to be pampered in the grottos of the Mendrisiotto region. \n\nAround 80 different species of fish and 30 marine and land reptiles have been discovered at the numerous excavation sites. What’s more, the scientists have also found hundreds of fossilised invertebrate animals and plants from the middle Triassic period, 230 to 245 million years ago. \n\nRemodeled and expanded by the Ticinese architect Mario Botta, the Fossil Museum in Meride exhibits a selection of fossilized animals and plants from the unique UNESCO World Heritage Site of Monte San Giorgio.",

    "description": "The paths wind through beautiful flower beds, lined with statues and fountains, and are framed by the meticulously manicured English lawn. The park is divided into two areas. The first area in the vicinity of the Villa Ciani can be reached through the main entrance at the end of the waterside promenade. This area has both the features of an Italian and an English garden: lush flower beds alternate with green spaces and trees and shrubs from all over the world. \n\nThe second area extends from the jetty to the Cassarate River and has a \"wilder\" and more original character. Here you will find oak, lime, plane and maple trees, all typical representatives of the Ticino forests. Within this forested area there is a children's playground with numerous games for children of all ages. \n\nThe Parco Ciani is also home to various buildings: the Villa Ciani, the Convention Centre, a jetty, the Natural History Museum and the Cantonal Library.",

    "description": "Strolling between historic facades and Lake Neuchâtel while discovering original artworks becomes a reality on the ArtiChoke route in Estavayer-le-Lac [https://www.myswitzerland.com/en/destinations/estavayer-le-lac/]. The highly accessible open-air gallery offers a thematic tour that is in stark contrast to the medieval town. Please allow a little more than an hour for your visit. The tour is self-guided using a map that can be downloaded or collected at no charge from the town’s tourist office. And if you would like to find out more about the artists, you can also book a guided tour.\n\nThe route brings together some fifteen works [https://www.fribourgregion.ch/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/estavayer-262900-brochuere-artichoke.pdf] that have been painted, modelled, shaped or produced using other techniques at various sites around the historic town. Swiss and international artists bring to life diverse and sometimes offbeat worlds.\n\nOne of the facades along the Grand-Rue has been decorated by Spanish artist Raquel Rodrigo, using an embroidery technique that is popular worldwide. You can also discover an impressive work made up of 788 origami works by French artist Mademoiselle Maurice. These urban artists have taken over a wall in Switzerland for the first time, where they will be presenting works created specifically for the tour.\n\nThe ArtiChoke Festival [https://www.artichokefestival.ch]is held in Estavayer-le-Lac every two years, in the summer. Art lovers and curious newcomers will not come away from the event disappointed. The programme includes live painting, musical animations, audiovisual performances, temporary exhibitions and culinary offerings with various food trucks.\n\nMore information [https://www.fribourgregion.ch/en/estavayer-payerne/visits/artichoke-itinerary-of-urban-art/] about the tour.\n\nWhat is the meaning behind the name “ArtiChoke”? The word comes from a combination of the words “art” and “choc”, the French word for “shock”. It alludes to the clash of medieval walls with contemporary urban art. A name that stands out and surprises.",

    "abstract": "At the very heart of Switzerland, a world record-holding technical innovation awaits: the steepest funicular railway in the world leads from Schwyz up to the car-free mountain village of Stoos. The journey there is an experience in itself, with passengers being taken up to a natural paradise 1,300 metres up.",
    "description": "The technical marvel will delight guests of all ages: the Stoosbahn reaches a gradient of 110% (47 degrees). It is the steepest funicular railway in the world. What’s really fascinating is that the spherical cabins adapt to the gradient perfectly. This enables passengers to stay upright at all times.\n\nThe journey from Schwyz to Stoos takes between 4 and 7 minutes. In the process, the Stoosbahn covers a total ascent of around 744 metres, and travels over two bridges and through three tunnels. After 1,740 metres, the funicular reaches the upper station in the middle of the mountain village. A natural paradise awaits with a wide range of leisure activities.\n\nThe holiday village of Stoos [https://www.myswitzerland.com/en/destinations/stoos/], sitting at about 1,300 metres up, can be found nestled in the Alpine landscape of Central Switzerland. There is a wide range of leisure activities on offer: from a hike along the ridge trail with impressive plunging views to fun in the water at the Little Stoos Lake or a leisurely picnic. Here, everyone will find the experience to suit them. In winter, ski slopes, winter hiking trails and snowshoe trails delight guests.\n\nGetting there: From Schwyz train station, buses take about 20 minutes to reach the “Stoosbahn” bus stop. Alternatively, take the car from Schwyz in the direction of Muotathal. The valley station and large car park is located directly on the road.\n\n\nINFORMATION\nGradient 110% (47.73 degrees) Altitude difference 744 metres Length 1,740 metres Duration Between 4 and 7 minutes Timetable Runs all year round, in line with the timetable [https://stoos-muotatal.ch/en/train/stoos-railways/] Special comments Fully included in the Swiss Travel Pass (Flex) / GA Travelcard.\nBook your tickets [https://www.myswitzerland.com/en/planning/transport-accommodation/tickets-public-transport/]",

Unique formations bear witness to the awesome power of nature when the continents of Africa and Europe collided. \n\nClearly visible from a great distance: the distinctive notch around the Piz Sardona separates the 250-million-year-old Verrucano rock from the 35 to 50 million years “young” Flysch rock. Extraordinary is that ancient stone formations overlie those that are millions of years younger - which was long an enigma for geologists, and a fact so unique that led it to the addition of the Swiss Tectonic Arena Sardona on the UNESCO World Heritage list in 2008. \n\nThe Glarus overthrust, particularly attractive to discover around the Martin’s Hole, forms the heart of the 300 square meter Sarganserland- Walensee-Glarnerland Geopark. \n\nEXCURSION TIP:“EXPEDITION TSCHINGLEN”\nThe excursion begins on the gondola lift from Elm to the Tschinglen Alp – right through the awe-inspiring gorge. In the gondola you will hear an exciting audio guide about the history of the Tectonic Arena. The Alp is the departure point for an approx. 1 ½ hour circular hike to the Firstboden viewpoint. The panorama extends from Martinsloch across Martinsmad and Mittagshorn down to the deep-cut valley floor.",

Experience what true darkness is when you extinguish all light and enjoy the acoustics of the cave with its many different sounds. An intense cave experience and a real adventure that you will rave about for a long time!\n\nThe exciting tour takes you through various corridors of the cave system, which the first Hölloch researchers discovered more than a hundred years ago with hobnail boots and candle lanterns. It is a small expedition, which means that you cannot always walk upright; at times you will have to climb, crawl, go up and down a ladder, or even slip through a narrow area. But don't worry. It's not too tight and the tour is easy to handle even with a normal level of physical fitness.\n\nArrival: By car: Parking near Restaurant Hölloch, Stalden 15, 6436 Muotathal. \nBy public transport: By train to Schwyz then bus no. 1 to the stop “Hölloch, Muotathal”\nTo bring with you: warm socks. Also bring old, robust clothes (jeans, pullovers, fleece jacket); alternatively, cave overalls can be rented on site for CHF 25.\nSuitable for families (children from age 9), couples, individuals. Groups of six or more can set their own entry time to the caves.",

Skiers or snowboarders hungry for adventure can even take a diversion to Italy. The Zermatt region is the perfect place to undertake a long-distance ski tour.",
    "description": "The plateau above the Theodul Glacier is home to Europe’s highest upper station. From here, it is about 2,000 metres back down to the valley. Thankfully, the route down the mountainside is peppered with restaurants serving delicious food and providing weary guests with a place to rest and recharge their batteries. Skiing, snowboarding and winter hiking are possible throughout the year in Zermatt. In short, this ski region is up there with the best of them and it is worth staying for several days to discover all that it has to offer. We recommend a trip to the Breuil-Cervinia region in the Italian Val D’Aosta. This part of the Matterhorn region boasts 160 kilometres of pistes covering all degrees of difficulty. So if you are in search of a bit of Italianità, look no further than Zermatt.\n\nMore information [https://www.zermatt.ch/en/unique/International-Ski-Area]",

    "description": "Over 130 years ago Zermatt pioneers discovered a particularly lovely natural attraction: the Gorner Gorge. The gorge was formed by the Gornera River over thousands of years and is known for its unique formations and spectacular waterfalls. The green-tinged serpentinite stone is around 220 million years old.\n\nA well-kept path passes through galleries and over wooden walkways. It is an easy 20-minute walk. You can continue on to Blatten or Moos if you would like a longer walk. More adventurous souls can hire a mountain guide to take a three to four-hour tour of the Gorner Gorge.\n\nFrom the middle of October it's worth visiting the gorge in the afternoon between 3 p.m. and 4 p.m. because the late afternoon sun turns the waters a striking turquoise.\n\nGetting there: Take the train to Zermatt. The entrance to the gorge is a 20-minute walk away.",

From here, the themed Marmot Trail leads back to Sunnegga and the five-lake trail into the valley of the Findel Glacier.\n\nFinally, a big cable car takes visitors to the summit of the Unterrothorn (3,103 metres above sea level). The views of most of the 38 four-thousand-metre peaks around Zermatt are quite simply breathtaking.\n\n\n\nAltitude: 3,103 metres \nHow to get there: Train from Brig/Visp to Zermatt, on foot or by free e-bus (green line) to the valley station Sunnegga-Rothorn: funicular to Sunnegga [https://www.matterhornparadise.ch/en/experience/peaks/sunnegga], gondola to Blauherd [https://www.matterhornparadise.ch/en/experience/peaks/blauherd], cable car to the Rothorn [https://www.matterhornparadise.ch/en/experience/peaks/rothorn]\nViews: Across Zermatt to the Obergabelhorn, Zinalrothorn and Weisshorn, with the Bernese Alps in the background, over the Findel Glacier to the Rimpfischhorn and Strahlhorn, over the Gornergrat ridge to Monte Rosa and of course the Matterhorn itself \nAttractions: Starting point to numerous themed hiking trails (e.g. Five Lakes Walk, Path to Freedom, Flower Trail), Moonlight descent in winter, Sunrise rides, Leisee lake with children’s playground\nFood and drink: Mountain restaurants at all levels, sun terraces with magnificent mountain views, Rothorn cablecar: Sunrise rides including Älpler breakfast every Tuesday during summer\nAccommodation: No accommodation at Sunnegga, Blauherd or Rothorn; Fluhalp has single, double, triple, quadruple and group rooms, Mountain Lodge Ze Seewjinu has double, triple, quadruple and group rooms\nGroups: Rothorn has two rooms with seating for 76 in each; Blauherd Blue Lounge; Sunegga has rooms with seating for 192, 140 and 100, conferences for up to 200, meeting rooms \nWinter: Rothorn Paradise winter sports area, linked to the Gornergrat and Matterhorn Paradise \nSpecial comments: Probably the most photogenic angle for Matterhorn views!\n\nBook your tickets [https://www.matterhornparadise.ch/en/book/tickets/rothorn]",

The skiers follow a route over the Riffelberg and the Theodul glacier up to Trockener Steg. At that point, the adventurers might start to notice a slight pull in their thighs, but it’s not time to give up yet.

The adventure park is perfect for children and teenagers up to approx. 12 years old and offers slides, climbing frames and swings as well as water games and wooden ball runs. The idyllic mountain lake invites you to cool off refreshingly, while the adventurous can pull themselves across the water on a wooden raft on a rope. From the shore you also have a fantastic view of the Matterhorn [https://www.myswitzerland.com/en/destinations/matterhorn-4478-m-asl-landmark-of-switzerland/]and the surrounding mountains. On the shore, loungers also invite you to relax.\n\nThe path to the playground is easily accessible and signposted from the Sunnegga mountain station with a stroller. Near the playground there are tables, benches, a toilet, barbecue and picnic areas and a kiosk. Important: Don't forget sunscreen and headgear! A few sun sails provide protection, otherwise no shade clouds the spectacular panorama on the Sunnegga – the name speaks for itself.",
