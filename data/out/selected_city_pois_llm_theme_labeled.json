    "abstract": "The Grossmünster is an Evangelical Protestant church in the Old Town of Zurich and the city's landmark. The view from the church towers is spectacular: far across Lake Zurich to the Alps.",
    "description": "In the first half of the 16th century, the Grossmünster served as the starting point of the Reformation under Huldrych Zwingli and Heinrich Bullinger. The characteristic tops of its neo-Gothic towers were added by Johann Caspar Voegeli and John Hagge Mille from 1781 to 1787. Between 1913 and 1915 the interior renovations were completed by Gustav Gull and Hermann Fietz.\n\nParticularly worth seeing are the glass windows by Sigmar Polke, the Romanesque crypt, the Romanesque capitals in the church and cloister, the stained glass windows by Augusto Giacometti (1932), the bronze doors by Otto Münch (1935 and 1950), and the Reformation museum in the cloister. Guided tours are available.\n\nThe so-called Karlsturm is one of the two Grossmünster towers of this famous Zurich landmark. 187 stairs lead from the nave up to the tower vantage point – from where visitors have bird’s-eye views over the Zurich rooftops [https://www.myswitzerland.com/en/experiences/zurichs-old-town/]and lake [https://www.myswitzerland.com/en/destinations/lake-zurich/]as well as majestic Alpine summits on the horizon.",

    "description": "Founded in 1868, the Tonhalle Orchestra is the oldest symphony orchestra in Switzerland. With the opening of the Zurich Tonhalle in 1895, the orchestra was given a hall whose acoustics are rated among the best in the world. The magnificent hall was inaugurated in the presence of Johannes Brahms. Top-class conductors have helped to turn the Tonhalle Orchestra into what it is today, with a series of CD recordings of works by Richard Strauss, Robert Schumann and Gustav Mahler that document its rise to prominence. The seminal complete recording of Beethoven's symphonies in the late 1990s won the “German Record Critics' Award” and caused a sensation in the music world. \n\nIn recent years, the Zurich Tonhalle Orchestra has emerged as one of Europe's leading ensembles. Its highly motivated musicians present approximately 100 public concerts each season, with about 50 different programmes. Since the 2019/2020 season, the Estonian conductor Paavo Järvi has been Music Director of the orchestra, whose family concerts bring joy to young listeners. Designed for twenty-somethings, tonhalleLATE is a series of exceptional events combining a classical concert with a party including electronic music.\n\nAlthough the Tonhalle is home to the Tonhalle Orchestra, the grand hall is also used by many other orchestras keen to demonstrate their skill in this wonderful setting with its magnificent acoustics.",

    "description": "Since opening in 1889, the Polybahn has carried over two million passengers each year to the Polyterrasse between the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology and the University in just two and a half minutes. The route has not changed at all since it first came into service in 1889, and is a historic monument to late 19th century engineering.\n\nSaved from closure at the last minute by a Swiss bank in 1976, the historic Polybahn was completely overhauled in 1996 and equipped with state-of-the-art technology, and in 2001 the upper station was repainted in its original Sienna red colour. Thanks to this complete overhaul, the Student Express, also affectionately known as the “Polybähnli”, will continue to transport future generations from Central to Zurich’s seats of learning and back.\n\nHow to get there: Walk from Zurich main station, crossing the Limmat to Central, then take the funicular to the Polyterrasse.\n\n\nAltitude: 452 metres \nHow to get there: \nWalk from Zurich main station, crossing the Limmat to Central, then take the funicular to the Polyterrasse \nViews: Across the city and Lake Zurich to the Glärnisch, Tödi, Clariden, the Albis chain and the Uetliberg \nAttractions: The funicular itself, which carries over two million people every year \nFood and drink: Speciality restaurants in nearby Niederdorf \nAccommodation: Zurich city (the Hotel Limmathof is right next to the lower station of the Polybahn) \nWinter: Runs all year round \nSpecial comments: No service on Sundays",

    "description": "In July 1835, the first iron steamboat on the European continent, the “Minerva”, went into service on Lake Zurich. To keep pace with passenger demand at the start of the last century, two large paddle steamers were then ordered: the sister vessels “Stadt Zürich” (built in 1909) and “Stadt Rapperswil” (built in 1914). Together with the “Helvetia” (built in 1875, the largest paddle steamer on Lake Zurich), the three boats formed the backbone of the Zurich fleet for many decades. \n\nToday, the Lake Zurich fleet comprises 17 boats: 15 motor vessels including three Limmat boats and the two remaining paddle steamers. The “Helvetia” left service in 1958, having covered a total of 200,000km. In March 2007, the 700-passenger ship \"Panta Rhei\" joined the fleet.",

From here, large rocks or small pebble beaches will lead you down to Lake Zurich. Shady trees and areas with lots of space on which to play or relax, such as the Blatterwiese, invite you to stop and linger awhile.\n\nFollowing on from the “Expo 64” in Lausanne, the “Heureka” sculpture by Jean Tinguely was given a new home on the Zürichhorn, ultimately becoming a striking new part of the lakeside promenade.\n\nThe Chinese Garden was a gift from the city’s Chinese sister city of Kunming in thanks for the technical and scientific support provided for the expansion of the drinking water supply and urban drainage in Kunming. It is classed as a temple garden and is one of the highest-ranking gardens outside of China.",

Visitors come to Treib where they take the funicular, installed in 1916, that brings them up the mountain to Seelisberg.\nToday, this nostalgic journey holds a special treat at dusk: the funicular is slowed down and as it inches down the mountain, fondue is served on the little tables between the banquettes. An accordion player plays old tunes and the view is just as romantic as can be as one slowly descends towards the valley's lights. After coffee and dessert is served on the terrace of the Hotel Treib, the funicular once again ascends to Seelisberg.\nFor groups of 10-25 persons daily beyond the scheduled timing .

Skiing, sledging, ice skating, cross-country skiing or a winter hike: countless winter adventures await you in the Lucerne-Lake Lucerne Region.\n\nIn magical Lucerne, a magic awakens during the Advent season that casts a spell over everyone. Twinkling lights and Christmas music lead visitors from Christmas market to Christmas market, where they are spoiled with regional and international delicacies. Local producers showcase their handicrafts - the perfect opportunity to buy those last-minute Christmas presents. \n\nDuring the city tour \"Tannengrün und Lichterglanz\", a guide reveals the secrets of Santa Claus and the Christ Child and explains how the Christmas tree finds its way into the warm living room, how the lights find their place and much more. Advent in Lucerne is a time of wonder and contemplation, when people come together to enjoy the warmth and magic of this special time of year.\n\nMore information: Christmas in Lucerne [https://www.luzern.com/en/highlights/christmas-in-lucerne/]",

Within 2 hours you will come to know a lot of facts on the inner and outer life of the 5-km long river of ice. Moraines, Alpine flowers at the edge of the glacier, typical rock formations and characteristic landscape are pointed out and explained in lay terms. The trail gets close and almost enters the mouth of the glacier that looks like a black cave above the milky-white Lake Steinsee, before it ascends to the vantage point. From here the view sweeps over the limestone rocks of the Wendenstoecke across high moorland and mountain lakes, Alpine meadows and pine forest up to the icy glacier. \nA detailed brochure on the glacier trail is available at Hotel Steingletscher for CHF 5.--.\n\nHow to get there:\nDrive or take public transportation from Meiringen or Luzern/Erstfeld/Wassen to Steingletscher on the Susten Pass.",

The airborne water in the permanent jet weighs more than five tons. \n\nThe Jet d'Eau is best viewed from the Bains des Pâquis, a popular swimming venue for the locals.

On the ground, there is the contrast between the granite of various colours representing the diversity of nations, and the concrete strips that are the traditional building material of Geneva. A dozen water jets of varying heights shoot up directly from the ground. The square is also home to the gigantic \"Broken Chair\", symbol of the fight against landmines and the fresco of peace, a huge ceramic mosaic created by Swiss artist Hans Erni at the age of 100.",

    "description": "Every hour on the hour, a fascinating spectacle takes place in Bern: the medieval puppet show of the Zytglogge (clock tower) begins. The dancing bear train, the cheeky jester and the crowing rooster are a delight for young and old alike.\n\nIf you would like to know more about the significance of the statues, the mechanics and the history of the Zytglogge (clock tower), you can take part in the one-hour guided tour.\n\nThe tour is a special experience, and not just because of the unique atmosphere inside the tower. Time seems to have stood still here many years ago, while heavy wooden beams and solid stone walls take guests on a journey into the past. In the historic rooms, only the steady ticking of the medieval mechanism accompanies visitors through history.\n\nAlso part of the tour: the ascent to the viewing platform. A wonderful panoramic view over the alleyways and rooftops of the old town and the green surroundings awaits.\n\nFurther information and booking:Zytglogge tour [http://www.bern.com/en/detail/berns-clock-tower-zytglogge]",

The cathedral represents the last major work of late Gothic architecture in Europe.",
    "description": "The interior architecture of the Münster attests to the cathedral's construction during the city's conversion from Catholicism to Protestantism. The choir's religious symbols are strongly Catholic; coats of arms on the ceiling's keystones come from Protestant times; empty statuary niches reveal religious artworks that were removed and destroyed at the transition. Other notable design elements include unusual black ceiling flourishes, added after the Gothic had gone out of fashion; the massive granite altar taken from Lausanne Cathedral; and the 15th-century Last Judgment sculpture over the main portal. Protestant church leaders left the carving intact because of its justice theme. 234 human figures, from high and low ranks, religious leaders including the pope and lay people, are represented. Some of each group head to heaven, and some to hell.",

    "description": "Since 1513 bears have been at home in Bern; until 1857 in the town itself, then in the bear pit, and since 2009 in the new and spacious Bärenpark.\n\nThe site on the banks of the Aare stretches from the former bear pit opposite the Old Town [https://www.myswitzerland.com/en/experiences/old-city-of-bern/]to the river. Thanks to a lift, the entire facility is now wheelchair-friendly. The “Bear Pit”, which still exists and has been listed as a federal cultural asset of national significance, remains at the bears' disposal. \n\nGuests can go on a tour of the old bear pit as well as the new bear park. They get to see the new park with its green hilly terrain, which includes caves and the \"Bear Bath\" in the Aare River [https://www.myswitzerland.com/en/destinations/aare/]. Guided tours can also be booked during which you learn plenty of interesting things concerning the history of the Bärenpark - a peek behind the scenes.",

From 1956 to 1962 the park was redesigned, introducing rhododendrons and azaleas as well as an iris garden.\n\nA pavilion and reading garden provide a place to relax.

Those who prefer to sleep outside can do so at Camping Eichholz: there’s no better feeling than opening the zip of your tent in the morning, poking your head outside and seeing the shimmering turquoise waters of the river there in front of you.

    "description": "During the Advent season, the scent of gingerbread, roasted almonds and mulled wine wafts through the festively decorated streets of Bern's old town. If you follow them, you will find great Christmas markets and pop-ups in various squares. From traditional to artisanal to a paradise for foodies: Each Christmas market impresses with its very own character. \n\nThe UNESCO World Heritage Site with its old town houses dating from the 15th to 17th centuries and Bern Minster - the highest church tower in Switzerland - provides a fantastic and unique backdrop. Even away from the markets, a Christmas shopping spree is a special experience thanks to the 6 kilometers of arcades and the typical Bernese vaulted cellars. \n\nFor those who like a picture-book Christmas, we recommend a trip to other parts of the Bern region. From the romantic Christmas market in Huttwil and the lovingly decorated chalets at the Kambly Experience to what is probably the largest nativity scene in the Central Plateau - Christmas lovers can also experience wonderful atmospheres in the Gantrisch Nature Park, the Emmental, Oberaargau and Laupen.\n\n [https://www.bern.com/de/weihnachten]More information: Christmas in Bern [www.bern.com/weihnachten]",

    "abstract": "River rafting on the Aare between Thun and Bern is now possible by canoe or inflatable boat, with expert guides coaching you through fast and slow currents.",
    "description": "Whether on your own or under the guidance of professional guides, you decide how you want to discover this unique Swiss river. The Aareböötle is enjoyed by thousands of locals and tourists alike every year and what could be better than spending the day on the river and arriving in the capital city of Bern. The most famous stretch is the one from Thun (Uttigen) to Bern, where you arrive either at Camping Eichholz in Wabern or directly at the Marzili swimming pool below the Parliament House.\n\nOn a hot summer's day, you can see hundreds of boats, tubes, SUPs and kayaks floating down the river. If that's all too much for you, the much quieter section of the river from Worblaufen to Wohlensee is just as beautiful, only with far fewer visitors. And for the more adventurous among you who like to be alone on the water, the river goes much further, all the way to Solothurn and beyond.\n\nWherever and however you want to experience the Aare, make sure you have the right equipment with you: a good, solid boat, a life jacket, paddle, repair kit and sun protection. The regulations for lifejackets are complex and each type of boat requires a different type of lifejacket, so make sure you have the right one. To enjoy the Aare in the safest way possible, contact one of the professional rental and activity companies who will provide you with the best possible equipment and guidance. You pick up your equipment, get a good briefing and return the equipment to Bern at the end of the tour. Simple.\n\nMore information here [https://www.aareschlauchboot.ch/aare-boat-rental].",

    "description": "Hiking across the imposing Aletsch Glacier is always an unforgettable experience. Surrounded by the most famous 4,000m peaks of the Bernese and Valais Alps, passing imposing crevasses and enjoying a breathtaking view of the immense alpine glaciers.\n\nThis unique adventure begins as soon as we collect you from the meeting point and accompany you on the journey by gondola lift and train to the Jungfraujoch. The Jungfraujoch is located on the main European water divide (Rhône/Rhine) at 3,454m above sea level, making this the highest train station in Europe.\nOnce you are roped up and equipped with a climbing harness and a ski pole, our IFMGA mountain guides will skillfully guide you across the glacier.\n\nAs we hike across the glacier, our guides will explain how we promote sustainability and the importance of preserving the alpine glacial region.\nOne of our focal points is climate change, one of the main causes of glacier melt. You will learn how climate change affects the glaciers, the impact this has on the ecosystem and the water cycle, and the importance of taking steps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to slow down glacier retreat.\n\nThe walking distance and the speed of our progress on the glacier can be individually adapted to the needs of your group. After a break, you will visit the majestic Jungfraujoch under the watchful eye of your OUTDOOR guides. Visitors cannot fail to be impressed by this extensive and striking complex, planned and subsequently built in true pioneering spirit at the end of the 19th century.\nThe Jungfraujoch building is a prime example of sustainable planning and construction. The pioneering construction and the maintenance of the facility are perfect examples of sustainable building and the careful handling of sensitive alpine areas.\n\nWe visit the highest vantage point on the Jungfraujoch, the “Sphinx”, the Ice Palace with its examples of ice art, the glacier plateau and follow the “Alpine Sensation” tour, which provides us with musical accompaniment and interesting information about the planning and construction work on the Jungfraujoch. Along the way, you will learn key facts about the construction and maintenance of the Jungfraujoch and the ways in which it benefits science and the tourism industry.\n\nThis group activity on the glacier promotes team building, addresses the importance of preserving the alpine region, raises awareness and motivates visitors to make the long-term sacrifices needed to secure the future of the glaciers.",

Getting an unusual bird's eye view of the unique Jungfrau panorama is sure to make you forget everything else for a while!\nNothing can beat the flight down from the Beatenberg to Interlaken for excitement and a really special experience.",

The cable car can accommodate 100 persons on each ride. At the same time it can carry 6,000 kilograms of freight. The ride takes 4 minutes. \n\nFrom Grütschalp to Mürren \nAn adhesion railway runs on the romantic stretch across alpine meadows to Mürren. This ride traverses an additional 147 meters. \n\nMürren is not accessible by car. For this reason freight transport is especially important. Transportation is carried out by means of containers, which are transferred to the freight compartment of the adhesion train at the intermediate station’s ultra-modern loading facility. \n\nThe Lauterbrunnen-Mürren mountain train was opened in 1891. There is an additional means of traveling to Mürren: by aerial cable car from Stechelberg (the aerial cable car continues onward via Gimmelwald to Schilthorn).",

This guided night-time snowshoe tour is an experience that is in a class of its own. The nocturnal atmosphere underneath the starry sky is so beautiful, you’re bound to fall in love with it. Accompanied by a mountain guide and equipped with a head torch, guests tramp through the enchanting winter landscape. All you can hear is your breathing and the crunch of the snow under your snowshoes. Step by step, you will advance through the atmospheric night, marvelling at the sea of lights in the valley, the snow glistening in the moonlight and the stars twinkling in the night sky. There is tea and mulled wine to warm you up along the way. At the end of the tour, guests can look forward to a fine cheese fondue in the Jägerstübli restaurant. \n\n\"",

No wonder that this is the source of Switzerland’s Grand Crus in wine. \n\nTake to the train, your bicycle or even walk to discover the 800 hectares of terraced vineyards of the Lavaux that have been accorded UNESCO World-Heritage listing. A footpath of 32 km in length leads from Lausanne-Ouchy to Chillon Castle. En route you'll find 7 circuits complete with information panels detailing every facet of local viticulture. Taste locally produced wines in an authentic wine cellar and learns more about local wine growing culture and grape varieties.FROM VINE TO WINE IN LAVAUX\nAssist a Lavaux winemaker in his daily work and enjoy an authentic experience of man and vine. This half-day of discovery includes working in the vineyard or the cellar (depending on the season), visiting the estate, wine tasting with a snack and a bottle of wine to take home as a souvenir. All reservations must, if possible, be made at least one week in advance.\nDuration: 3h\nNumber of participants: 2-10\nLanguages: German, English, French\n\nMore information [https://www.region-du-leman.ch/en/Z9278/lavaux-unesco-terraced-vineyards?utm_campaign=dieschweizelektrisiert&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=myswitzerand&utm_content=de&utm_term=lavaux]",

He fell in love with Montreux and Lake Geneva and decided to settle here. He said, among other things, \"If you want peace of soul, come to Montreux\". \n\nTo commemorate his time in Montreux, a bronze statue of Freddie Mercury was placed by the waterfront in 1996.

It was declared a national natural heritage site in the Sixties, but thanks to the visionaries of the time, the lake was not exposed to mass tourism as originally planned. It can still be visited, however, and you can even stay in the charming little mountain inn on the Western shore of the lake.\nThe road leading to Lac de Taney is closed to private vehicles.

    "description": "Wasserauen is the last stop on the Appenzell Railway. From there, the ultra-modern cable car carries passengers up the steep 723-metre climb to the Ebenalp (1,644 metres above sea level) in just six minutes.\n\nFrom the upper station, the path leads down through the prehistoric Wildkirchli caves, which were inhabited around 40,000 years ago, then on to the hermit’s dwelling and the famous Berggasthaus Aescher mountain inn. Prehistoric stone tools were found in the area 100 years ago, evidence that the area was inhabited by hunter-gatherers during the Palaeolithic era (45,000 – 30,000 BC). The remains of cave bears were also found alongside the stone tools.\n\nThe Ebenalp is the ideal starting point for numerous easy to challenging hikes in the Alpstein massif. Taking in fragrant alpine meadows, impressive rock formations and magnificent lookout points, the hikes showcase the very best of the Appenzell region.INFORMATION\nAltitude: 1,640 metres \nHow to get there: Train to Appenzell and on to Wasserauen, cable car to the Ebenalp.\nViews: To the Seealp and Meglisalp, Säntis, Altmann and Hoher Kasten, across the Appenzell region and Lake Constance to Germany and further west to the Feldberg \nAttractions: Alpine garden at the Berggasthaus Ebenalp mountain inn \nFood and drink: Hearty, home-style, Appenzell specialities \nWinter: Winter sports area with ski lifts on the Ebenalp \nSpecial comments: The secure path to the Aescher mountain inn passes through the caves\nDiscounted mountain ascent with Swiss Travel Pass/GA travelcard.\nBuy your tickets on arrival at the station.\n\n\n\nDAY TRIPS TO THE MOUNTAINS\nBuy your return rail and mountain ascent tickets now\n\nTimetable and tickets [https://www.sbb.ch/de/kaufen/pages/fahrplan/fahrplan.xhtml?&nach=Ebenalp]",

The railway line never got further than the valley town, however, and so the cable car from Schwägalp to the top of the Säntis was opened in 1935. From the valley station, you glide almost weightlessly up to the imposing summit in around 10 minutes. At 2,502 metres above sea level, on clear days the mountain provides breathtaking views of France, Germany, Italy, Austria, Liechtenstein and Switzerland. \n\nThe Säntis also plays a key role in weather forecasting – a weather station was first installed on the mountain way back in 1882. An experiential world brings the impressive natural phenomena and their elementary effects to life. A second experiential world – “Säntis – the Ice World” – was opened in 2020. Visitors learn all about snow, ice, ice crystals and glaciers through a series of fun activities and displays.\n\nIn summer, numerous special experiences such as full moon trips, sunrise ascents or Säntis-Spitzegnoss evenings attract visitors to the mountain.INFORMATION\nAltitude: 2,502 m.a.s.l.\nHow to get there: Train to Urnäsch or Nesslau, PostBus to Schwägalp, cable car to the Säntis in 10 minutes\nViews: Across the Appenzell region and the Alpstein mountain range to Lake Constance, Vorarlberg, the Graubünden Alps as far as the Bernina, in particular the Churfirsten range and beyond them the Tödi, Finsteraarhorn, Pilatus and Rigi, and across the Swiss Plateau to the Jura and Black Forest \nAttractions: Identify mountains and valleys from the viewing terraces, enjoy splendid sunrises and sunsets, full moon trips, a night on the Säntis \nFood and drink: Large, modern Säntisgipfel restaurant\nAlter Säntis mountain inn (summer only) \nAccommodation: Alter Säntis mountain inn: Double and multi-bed rooms, dormitories (summer only) \nHotel Schwägalp: Double rooms and tourist dormitories \nGroups: Rooms for events at the summit and at Schwägalp (extensive event brochure available online)\nAlter Säntis has space for 90 guests (function room) \nOperating times: Säntis cable car runs all year round (brief closure for maintenance, usually in January/February, check the timetable [https://saentisbahn.ch/en/experience/cablecar/timetable/])\nSwiss Travel Pass/GA travelcard: Discounted mountain ascent with Swiss Travel Pass/GA travelcard.

You decide the speed with the help of the brake lever.It's great fun for the entire family.\nThe bob sled run is open during summer season, weather permitting.

The 360° panorama is simply breathtaking. The views of the Rhine delta, the Kreuzberge Mountain and other sensational vistas like the \"Hundstein, famous among climbers, accompany the hiker on the way to Saxerlücke. Return to Brülisau via Lake Sämtis (return to Bollenwees is also possible).\n\nDuring the hike 20 orientation panels inform hikers about the creation of this mountain chain. One can see fossils, eroded structures, subterranean draining lakes, folds and fissures.\nHiking time is about three and a half hours, or six hours round trip to Brülisau.",

    "description": "Since May 2015, visitors to the Alpstein mountains in the Appenzell Alps can embark on the highest whisky trek in the world. The brainchild of the Locher brewery – famous for its Säntis Malt whisky – and the Bergwirte-Verein Alpstein (Alpstein mountain landlords’ association), the trek offers whisky-tasting like you’ve never experienced it before.Sepp Manser, landlord at the Berggasthaus Meglisalp mountain inn, came up with the idea of creating a whisky trek when he decided to serve up his own, unique version of Säntis Malt in 2012. His idea very swiftly became a reality – all 26 of the associated local mountain inns have now joined the trail, each with their very own barrel of whisky on hand for on-site tasting.Each of these barrels of whisky contains the same basic distillate, Säntis Malt made by the Locher brewery. But that’s where the similarity ends: Each of the barrels is unique, differing from the others in the type of wood used in its construction and its previous contents. The barrels are made from American, Portuguese, French or Russian oak, and were previously filled with desert wine, Merlot, Pinot noir, Sauvignon, Gamay, Zweigelt, port, sherry, rum, bourbon, damson schnapps or even beer. This diversity results in 26 totally unique flavours along the Appenzell Whisky Trek.Just seeing the barrels is an experience, not to mention the tasting of the whisky itself. As well as varying in flavour, the different whiskies each boast a different colour, with shades ranging from amber and white gold through to rose gold and deep copper.The exclusivity of the unique whiskies is upheld by ensuring that they are only available to taste in the individual mountain inn or to buy in small (1dl) or large (5dl) “one-of-a-kind” bottles, each signed personally by the “cask keeper” – the landlord.The Appenzell Whisky Trek has a brand-new attraction:\nan exclusive new trophy that you can see and even wear! If you collect all 26 whiskies on the Alpstein whisky trek, you’ll be rewarded with a new “finisher trophy” – an original Appenzell belt with a genuine silver buckle, designed by Alpine saddler Roger Dörig. This reward replaces all previous collectors’ activities.\nAs of 25 June 2021, every 100ml bottle of whisky you buy now comes with a “Fass-Bon”, or “barrel token”, which can be detached and stuck into the Whisky Trek collector’s pass. Once your pass is full, you will be rewarded with an exclusive leather belt featuring a genuine silver buckle, crafted by artisan leatherworker Roger Dörig (valued at CHF 350). You can choose the colour and length of your belt. The Whisky Trek belt buckle is only available as a Whisky Trek trophy and is not available for purchase. The campaign will run until the end of the 2023 season\nThe collector’s pass is available from participating mountain inns and from the Locher brewery’s “Brauquöll” visitors’ centre on Brauereiplatz in Appenzell. The belt can also be ordered there, or from Roger Dörig’s shop.\nOld, expired Whisky Trek coupons are no longer valid but can be exchanged for a free 100ml bottle in the “Brauquöll” centre. The centre also still sells the decorative 9-bottle wooden storage shelf, which can be used to display your collection of treasures.We hope you enjoy this true feast for the senses in the Alpstein mountains, where the whisky is as breathtakingly unique as the surrounding scenery.\n\n\nMore information:\nwww.whiskytrek.com [http://www.saentismalt.com/en/whiskytrek.html] www.alpstein.ch [http://www.alpstein.ch]INFORMATION\n\nwww.saentismalt.com [http://www.saentismalt.com/en/whiskytrek.html] www.alpstein.ch [http://www.alpstein.ch]",

    "abstract": "At the southern end of Lake Lugano is the 1,704 metre high Monte Generoso. This lofty altitude makes it without a doubt the best mountain for views in the canton of Ticino.",
    "description": "The new restaurant “Fiore di pietra” (stone flower) created by the famous architect Mario Botta stands majestically on a rugged plateau on the mountain. Its windows offer breathtaking 360° panoramic views, taking in the lakes, the city of Lugano as well as the Matterhorn and Jungfrau all the way to the Bernina Range.\n\nNostalgic journey to the summit\nA cog railway has been taking visitors up to the peak of Monte Generoso for 125 to enjoy these breathtaking views. It is about 9km long and runs along a magical stretch of mountain scenery in the Monte Generoso nature park. In addition to electric trains, nostalgic modes of transport also use this cog railway line, including the oldest steam train still in operation in Switzerland, built in 1890, and trains from the 1950s. A ride in these trains brings the time of the Belle Époque back to life.\n\nActivities on and around the mountain\nThere is much to discover on Monte Generoso: Keen hikers can explore the mountain on more than 51km of hiking trails. The Nature Trail and the Ice Pits Nevere are just two of the many hiking paths. The Ice Pits Nevere trail takes hikers to restored ice huts, which were once used to chill milk before it was churned into butter. The brave can marvel at the landscape around Monte Generoso from the air by paragliding from the top. Flights start on Monte Generoso and glide in different directions over the lakes, countryside and towns.\n\nINFORMATION\nHow to get there:\nDrive or take public transportation from Lugano to Capolago-Riva San Vitale, from there take the Monte Generoso mountain train to the top of Monte Generoso.\n\nSunset:\nIf you get a chance, don’t miss the sunset in Ticino. It’s a truly spectacular experience.\n\nFood/drink:\nThe “Fiore di pietra” gourmet restaurant and “Generoso” self-service restaurant will satisfy your hunger and thirst after a leisurely stroll or strenuous hike.\n\nFamilies:\nThe “Bear Cave” is about 30 minutes from the “Fiore di pietra” building on the Italian side of the mountain. Some 60,000 years ago, it was home to more than 800 cave bears. The cave's length is 200m, 70m of which have been made accessible to visitors. You need sturdy shoes, hiking gear and a hat to follow in the footsteps of the cave bears.\n\nPlease note:\nReduced rate mountain rail ascent with the Swiss Travel Pass / GA travelcard.\nBuy your tickets on arrival at the station.\n\nMore information about Monte Generoso [https://www.montegeneroso.ch/en]\n\n\nMOUNTAIN DAY TRIPS\nBuy your mountain rail ascent return tickets now\n\nTimetable and tickets [https://www.sbb.ch/en/buying/pages/fahrplan/fahrplan.xhtml?&nach=GenerosoVetta]",

    "description": "The Monte San Giorgio is the Swiss saurian mountain; it has gained in prominence as a transnational locality since 2010 when the UNESCO extension also took in the Italian side of the mountain. \n\nThis mountain has a truly rich inner life: rising just under 1100 metres in height, the Monte San Giorgio in the sunny south of Ticino has been a Mecca for fossil scientists since the 19th century, and a Unesco World Heritage site since 2003. Thousands of fossilised fish and marine saurians of up to six metres in length have already been unearthed here by eager palaeontologists. And for good reason: 230 to 245 million years ago, this was the site of a 100-metre-deep ocean basin. Today, at the southern end of Lake Lugano, the Monte San Giorgio rises like a pyramid – inside, filled with all manner of fossils. One can stroll through the vineyards along the southern slopes of the woody mountain, saunter through the idyllic town of Meride, or allow oneself to be pampered in the grottos of the Mendrisiotto region. \n\nAround 80 different species of fish and 30 marine and land reptiles have been discovered at the numerous excavation sites. What’s more, the scientists have also found hundreds of fossilised invertebrate animals and plants from the middle Triassic period, 230 to 245 million years ago. \n\nRemodeled and expanded by the Ticinese architect Mario Botta, the Fossil Museum in Meride exhibits a selection of fossilized animals and plants from the unique UNESCO World Heritage Site of Monte San Giorgio.",

At 1,624 metres above sea level, the mountain towers above the Malcantone region and offers panoramic views across southern Ticino and beyond. Monte Lema is the starting point for numerous hikes and bike tours, but also offers culinary highlights and unique views of the stars.",
    "description": "Not far from the town of Lugano, in the heart of the Malcantone region, Monte Lema rises to the sky. Easily accessible by cable car, the panoramic view from the upper station is unrivalled. The view extends from the rolling, densely wooded hills of Malcantone with its chestnut forests and picturesque villages to the town of Lugano. If you walk 10 minutes from the upper station to the peak on a clear day, you will be rewarded with a view of the Bernese and Valais Alps.\n\nThe restaurant is accessible via a barrier-free path. A spacious terrace and two cosy dining rooms in the restaurant invite you to linger. Typical Ticino dishes are served, ranging from polenta to the famous torta di pane (bread cake). There are also 22 simple beds available in the guest house. A night on the summit is unforgettable.\n\nIt is just a short walk from the restaurant to the observatory. During a guided tour, guests can immerse themselves in the vastness of the universe. The stars suddenly seem so much closer. Numerous events are held on Monte Lema during the summer too. For example, a moonlit hike or yoga with a view.\n\nMonte Lema is also the starting point for numerous hikes. Around 80 kilometres of hiking trails are waiting to be discovered. Leisurely circular hikes are ideal for hours of enjoyment. If you are looking for a greater challenge, you can undertake the famous ridge hike to Monte Tamaro. Impressive views are guaranteed. Bikers can expend their excess energy on a wide variety of trails.\n\nGetting there: Take the train from Bellinzona or Lugano to Lamone-Cadempino, bus directly to Miglieglia, cable car to Monte Lema.\n\nDAY TRIPS TO THE MOUNTAINS\nBuy your return rail and mountain ascent tickets now\n\nTimetable and tickets [https://www.sbb.ch/de/kaufen/pages/fahrplan/fahrplan.xhtml?&nach=MonteLema]",

The first area in the vicinity of the Villa Ciani can be reached through the main entrance at the end of the waterside promenade. This area has both the features of an Italian and an English garden: lush flower beds alternate with green spaces and trees and shrubs from all over the world. \n\nThe second area extends from the jetty to the Cassarate River and has a \"wilder\" and more original character. Here you will find oak, lime, plane and maple trees, all typical representatives of the Ticino forests. Within this forested area there is a children's playground with numerous games for children of all ages. \n\nThe Parco Ciani is also home to various buildings: the Villa Ciani, the Convention Centre, a jetty, the Natural History Museum and the Cantonal Library.",

    "description": "Strolling between historic facades and Lake Neuchâtel while discovering original artworks becomes a reality on the ArtiChoke route in Estavayer-le-Lac [https://www.myswitzerland.com/en/destinations/estavayer-le-lac/]. The highly accessible open-air gallery offers a thematic tour that is in stark contrast to the medieval town. Please allow a little more than an hour for your visit. The tour is self-guided using a map that can be downloaded or collected at no charge from the town’s tourist office. And if you would like to find out more about the artists, you can also book a guided tour.\n\nThe route brings together some fifteen works [https://www.fribourgregion.ch/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/estavayer-262900-brochuere-artichoke.pdf] that have been painted, modelled, shaped or produced using other techniques at various sites around the historic town. Swiss and international artists bring to life diverse and sometimes offbeat worlds.\n\nOne of the facades along the Grand-Rue has been decorated by Spanish artist Raquel Rodrigo, using an embroidery technique that is popular worldwide. You can also discover an impressive work made up of 788 origami works by French artist Mademoiselle Maurice. These urban artists have taken over a wall in Switzerland for the first time, where they will be presenting works created specifically for the tour.\n\nThe ArtiChoke Festival [https://www.artichokefestival.ch]is held in Estavayer-le-Lac every two years, in the summer. Art lovers and curious newcomers will not come away from the event disappointed. The programme includes live painting, musical animations, audiovisual performances, temporary exhibitions and culinary offerings with various food trucks.\n\nMore information [https://www.fribourgregion.ch/en/estavayer-payerne/visits/artichoke-itinerary-of-urban-art/] about the tour.\n\nWhat is the meaning behind the name “ArtiChoke”? The word comes from a combination of the words “art” and “choc”, the French word for “shock”. It alludes to the clash of medieval walls with contemporary urban art. A name that stands out and surprises.",

    "abstract": "At the very heart of Switzerland, a world record-holding technical innovation awaits: the steepest funicular railway in the world leads from Schwyz up to the car-free mountain village of Stoos. The journey there is an experience in itself, with passengers being taken up to a natural paradise 1,300 metres up.",
    "description": "The technical marvel will delight guests of all ages: the Stoosbahn reaches a gradient of 110% (47 degrees). It is the steepest funicular railway in the world. What’s really fascinating is that the spherical cabins adapt to the gradient perfectly. This enables passengers to stay upright at all times.\n\nThe journey from Schwyz to Stoos takes between 4 and 7 minutes. In the process, the Stoosbahn covers a total ascent of around 744 metres, and travels over two bridges and through three tunnels. After 1,740 metres, the funicular reaches the upper station in the middle of the mountain village. A natural paradise awaits with a wide range of leisure activities.\n\nThe holiday village of Stoos [https://www.myswitzerland.com/en/destinations/stoos/], sitting at about 1,300 metres up, can be found nestled in the Alpine landscape of Central Switzerland. There is a wide range of leisure activities on offer: from a hike along the ridge trail with impressive plunging views to fun in the water at the Little Stoos Lake or a leisurely picnic. Here, everyone will find the experience to suit them. In winter, ski slopes, winter hiking trails and snowshoe trails delight guests.\n\nGetting there: From Schwyz train station, buses take about 20 minutes to reach the “Stoosbahn” bus stop. Alternatively, take the car from Schwyz in the direction of Muotathal. The valley station and large car park is located directly on the road.\n\n\nINFORMATION\nGradient 110% (47.73 degrees) Altitude difference 744 metres Length 1,740 metres Duration Between 4 and 7 minutes Timetable Runs all year round, in line with the timetable [https://stoos-muotatal.ch/en/train/stoos-railways/] Special comments Fully included in the Swiss Travel Pass (Flex) / GA Travelcard.\nBook your tickets [https://www.myswitzerland.com/en/planning/transport-accommodation/tickets-public-transport/]",

Unique formations bear witness to the awesome power of nature when the continents of Africa and Europe collided. \n\nClearly visible from a great distance: the distinctive notch around the Piz Sardona separates the 250-million-year-old Verrucano rock from the 35 to 50 million years “young” Flysch rock. Extraordinary is that ancient stone formations overlie those that are millions of years younger - which was long an enigma for geologists, and a fact so unique that led it to the addition of the Swiss Tectonic Arena Sardona on the UNESCO World Heritage list in 2008. \n\nThe Glarus overthrust, particularly attractive to discover around the Martin’s Hole, forms the heart of the 300 square meter Sarganserland- Walensee-Glarnerland Geopark. \n\nEXCURSION TIP:“EXPEDITION TSCHINGLEN”\nThe excursion begins on the gondola lift from Elm to the Tschinglen Alp – right through the awe-inspiring gorge. In the gondola you will hear an exciting audio guide about the history of the Tectonic Arena. The Alp is the departure point for an approx. 1 ½ hour circular hike to the Firstboden viewpoint. The panorama extends from Martinsloch across Martinsmad and Mittagshorn down to the deep-cut valley floor.",

Experience what true darkness is when you extinguish all light and enjoy the acoustics of the cave with its many different sounds. An intense cave experience and a real adventure that you will rave about for a long time!\n\nThe exciting tour takes you through various corridors of the cave system, which the first Hölloch researchers discovered more than a hundred years ago with hobnail boots and candle lanterns. It is a small expedition, which means that you cannot always walk upright; at times you will have to climb, crawl, go up and down a ladder, or even slip through a narrow area. But don't worry. It's not too tight and the tour is easy to handle even with a normal level of physical fitness.\n\nArrival: By car: Parking near Restaurant Hölloch, Stalden 15, 6436 Muotathal. \nBy public transport: By train to Schwyz then bus no. 1 to the stop “Hölloch, Muotathal”\nTo bring with you: warm socks. Also bring old, robust clothes (jeans, pullovers, fleece jacket); alternatively, cave overalls can be rented on site for CHF 25.\nSuitable for families (children from age 9), couples, individuals. Groups of six or more can set their own entry time to the caves.",

    "description": "Over 130 years ago Zermatt pioneers discovered a particularly lovely natural attraction: the Gorner Gorge. The gorge was formed by the Gornera River over thousands of years and is known for its unique formations and spectacular waterfalls. The green-tinged serpentinite stone is around 220 million years old.\n\nA well-kept path passes through galleries and over wooden walkways. It is an easy 20-minute walk. You can continue on to Blatten or Moos if you would like a longer walk. More adventurous souls can hire a mountain guide to take a three to four-hour tour of the Gorner Gorge.\n\nFrom the middle of October it's worth visiting the gorge in the afternoon between 3 p.m. and 4 p.m. because the late afternoon sun turns the waters a striking turquoise.\n\nGetting there: Take the train to Zermatt. The entrance to the gorge is a 20-minute walk away.",

    "description": "The journey into the mountains begins with the underground funicular railway to Sunnegga (2,288 metres above sea level). This was the first funicular in Switzerland to travel entirely inside a tunnel. At Sunnegga you can watch marmots at play, while the nearby Leisee lake is the perfect spot for a swim.\n\n The journey then continues by eight-person gondola to Blauherd (2,571 metres above sea level). From here, the themed Marmot Trail leads back to Sunnegga and the five-lake trail into the valley of the Findel Glacier.\n\nFinally, a big cable car takes visitors to the summit of the Unterrothorn (3,103 metres above sea level). The views of most of the 38 four-thousand-metre peaks around Zermatt are quite simply breathtaking.\n\n\n\nAltitude: 3,103 metres \nHow to get there: Train from Brig/Visp to Zermatt, on foot or by free e-bus (green line) to the valley station Sunnegga-Rothorn: funicular to Sunnegga [https://www.matterhornparadise.ch/en/experience/peaks/sunnegga], gondola to Blauherd [https://www.matterhornparadise.ch/en/experience/peaks/blauherd], cable car to the Rothorn [https://www.matterhornparadise.ch/en/experience/peaks/rothorn]\nViews: Across Zermatt to the Obergabelhorn, Zinalrothorn and Weisshorn, with the Bernese Alps in the background, over the Findel Glacier to the Rimpfischhorn and Strahlhorn, over the Gornergrat ridge to Monte Rosa and of course the Matterhorn itself \nAttractions: Starting point to numerous themed hiking trails (e.g. Five Lakes Walk, Path to Freedom, Flower Trail), Moonlight descent in winter, Sunrise rides, Leisee lake with children’s playground\nFood and drink: Mountain restaurants at all levels, sun terraces with magnificent mountain views, Rothorn cablecar: Sunrise rides including Älpler breakfast every Tuesday during summer\nAccommodation: No accommodation at Sunnegga, Blauherd or Rothorn; Fluhalp has single, double, triple, quadruple and group rooms, Mountain Lodge Ze Seewjinu has double, triple, quadruple and group rooms\nGroups: Rothorn has two rooms with seating for 76 in each; Blauherd Blue Lounge; Sunegga has rooms with seating for 192, 140 and 100, conferences for up to 200, meeting rooms \nWinter: Rothorn Paradise winter sports area, linked to the Gornergrat and Matterhorn Paradise \nSpecial comments: Probably the most photogenic angle for Matterhorn views!\n\nBook your tickets [https://www.matterhornparadise.ch/en/book/tickets/rothorn]",

The 160 km distance (of which 86 km are on the Valais side and the other 74 km are in the Piemont and Aosta region) is divided into 8 stages and includes 7 mountain passes. Its highest summit, the Dufourspitze (4,634m above sea level), is Switzerland's highest summit and was first climbed in 1855. Europe's highest restaurant is situated on the mountain's 4,554 meter high signalling mound. The Monte Rosa east face is said to be the most imposing rock wall of the Alps. The name originates from an extinct Romance language and means glacier. The Swiss side of the massif can be viewed from the Gornergrat. This walking tour takes 4 days and is suitable for very experienced walkers only.",

The rules of the top-speed ski safari are simple: never take the same cable car or use the same slope twice on the same day. The challenge starts at the Rothorn at an altitude of over 3,000 metres. The skiers follow a route over the Riffelberg and the Theodul glacier up to Trockener Steg. At that point, the adventurers might start to notice a slight pull in their thighs, but it’s not time to give up yet. Once they reach the glacial paradise of the Matterhorn, the challengers take a short breather and admire the impressive mountain landscape. Then it’s a short detour to Breuil-Cervinia, across the border to Italy. In the evening, the tired heroes once again return to the village of Zermatt via Stafelalp. Exhausted but happy, and with an elevation gain of at least 10,000 metres under their belt.",

The adventure park is perfect for children and teenagers up to approx. 12 years old and offers slides, climbing frames and swings as well as water games and wooden ball runs. The idyllic mountain lake invites you to cool off refreshingly, while the adventurous can pull themselves across the water on a wooden raft on a rope. From the shore you also have a fantastic view of the Matterhorn [https://www.myswitzerland.com/en/destinations/matterhorn-4478-m-asl-landmark-of-switzerland/]and the surrounding mountains. On the shore, loungers also invite you to relax.\n\nThe path to the playground is easily accessible and signposted from the Sunnegga mountain station with a stroller. Near the playground there are tables, benches, a toilet, barbecue and picnic areas and a kiosk. Important: Don't forget sunscreen and headgear! A few sun sails provide protection, otherwise no shade clouds the spectacular panorama on the Sunnegga – the name speaks for itself.",

    "description": "It feels like being in another time as you walk through the majestic palace, pause by the pool in the atrium, climb the huge stone staircase and stroll through the magnificent galleries. The Palais de Rumine is a window on the past – and worth visiting just for the architecture: with its Florentine Renaissance style and grand proportions, it dominates the Place de la Riponne on the western edge of the Old Town. Until 1970 it served as the main building of Lausanne University, and now houses five museums including the renowned Musée cantonal des Beaux-Arts. The art museum holds the largest collection by the Vaud artist, Félix Vallotton.\n\nThe palace was named after Gabriel Rumine, a civil engineer of Russian origin who was born in Lausanne. He died in 1871 at the age of just 30, bequeathing 1.5 million Swiss francs to the city. As luck would have it, the gift coincided with plans to expand the Lausanne Academy into a fully-fledged university with a respectable headquarters. Opened in 1906, the building became a historic location 17 years later: it was here that the Treaty of Lausanne was signed, establishing among other things the present-day borders of Turkey and Greece.",

Perched in his den 75 metres above ground, at the heart of the high tower, the watchman sends his message to four points on the horizon across the roofs of the old town. “C’est le guet, il a sonné dix, il a sonné dix...” (This is the night watch, the hour has struck…). In so doing, he keeps alive a tradition that stretches back more than 600 years – to the Middle Ages, when his predecessors played the all-important role of raising the alarm when fire broke out in the city.\n\nThis spectacle lasts twenty minutes and can be seen from some bridges and squares in the town, since the tower is illuminated especially for this purpose.\n\nMore information [https://www.lausanne-tourisme.ch/en/explore/lausanne-cathedral/]",

    "name": "Kandersteg-Allmenalp via ferrata",
    "city": "kandersteg",
    "description": "A via ferrata in stunning countryside, along a 350-metre high wall, arranged in a series of columns and gorges, over which - and through which - the Allmibach flows, creating four waterfalls. For 20 years, paragliders have found promising thermals above this wall, which gets the full benefit of the morning sun. Since summer 2005, via ferrata climbers too have been making the climb, at a point not far from the northern end of the Lötschbergtunnel, to reach a cleverly laid-out via ferrata with a number of surprises in store. It is a route which does not artificially seek out the vertical, but does not shy away from it either. The Köppel brothers (who helped to design the Leukerbad via ferrata, the longest and most demanding in Switzerland) worked on the Kandersteg-Allmenalp via ferrata. As a result, the northern and southern ends of the Gemmi Pass, with its various climbs dating from the 18th century which can still evoke fear today, have modern iron ways for mountain sports enthusiasts who deliberately seek out the sensation of vertigo, and with safety in mind. \n\n\nDifficulty\nK4; the key to the climb is the vertical wall shortly after the start, with the most spectacular passage being the route below and above the roof overhang. Two three-rope bridges, each around 30 metres in length, cross the Allmibach; instead of using the upper bridge, there is also the option of using a Tyrolienne traverse to skim over the water. Two more Tyrolienne traverses are planned, leading from the via ferrata off to the right, to the rocky head and then back down to the climb. These should guarantee even more of that adrenalin buzz. The Kandersteg-Allmenalp via ferrata is open from the start of June to mid-October, when the Allmenalp cable-car is running. Warning: construction is during June 2005; official opening on July 30, 2005.\n\nStarting-point\nKandersteg rail station (1,176 m) or Allmenalp-Luftseilbahn valley station (1,181 m) to the south-west of the village.\n\nWalk-in\nFrom Kandersteg rail station, take the hiking route into the valley. Where the Allmibach flows into the river Kander, turn right and to the north of the stream, reaching the start of the via ferrata at roughly 1,250 m. From the Allmenalp-Luftseilbahn valley station, cross farmland and a private bridge over the stream to join the route already mentioned.\n\nRoute\nClimb, keeping to the left, along a 100-metre high wall, vertical in places. Cross a three-rope bridge over the Allmibach. A grassed slope leads to a step, with a roof which projects over it by 10 metres and which is conquered using a unique piece of design (a suspended walkway and a ladder which turns through 180 degrees). To the left of the second-lowest waterfall, the climb rises to an edge, behind which the Allmibach roars and falls. A second three-rope bridge crosses it again - brave via ferrata climbers naturally elect for the option further up, involving travel along a 40-metre long suspended rope. To finish, there is a final wall to the exit point, at around 1,600 m. It is a 20-minute walk up to the Undere Allme (1,723 m) with the mountain station of the Allmenalpbahn and the \"Beiz-\" (inn). \n\nDescent\nBy cable-car. Alternatively, on foot via Ryharts and Schneitböde in 1 _ hours. Alternatively, take a tandem paraglider flight!\n\n[http://img.myswitzerland.com/gad/12879/images/k_buch.jpg] Quelle:\nEugen E.

    "city": "kandersteg",
    "description": "During the Middle Ages, the Gemmi Pass was one of the most important links for goods and people travelling between the Bernese Oberland and Valais. These days, the mule track across the Alpine plateau is an exciting hiking trail – even in winter. The cable car from Kandersteg to Sunnbüel covers the first 700 metres of ascent in just 10 minutes. Here, at the tree line, at 1,200 metres above sea level, the four-hour winter hike begins. It passes through the broad basin of the Spittelmatte and, in a short ascent taking about 30 minutes, climbs to the Schwarenbach mountain hotel. \n\nOriginally built as a customs post in 1742, this establishment has hosted celebrated figures such as Mark Twain, Lenin and Pablo Picasso. Even the exterior of the Schwarenbach is impressive, bringing history to life. After some light refreshments, continue up the sunny side of the valley until a wide area opens up – the frozen, snow-covered Daubensee lake at 2,200 metres above sea level. If you have enough power in your legs you can complete the last 100 metres of the ascent on foot. Alternatively, the 8-person gondola will whisk exhausted hikers up to the Gemmi Pass, the final destination for this route and a spectacular lookout point.\n\nWith a bit of luck, you might even spot a bearded vulture flying overhead at the pass. These raptors have re-established themselves here in recent years, and the opportunities to observe them are unrivalled anywhere in Europe.",

One section of this spectacular mountain pass road to the Chluse Gorge had to be dynamited. Masonry parapets, dry stone walls, kerbs, arched bridges, tunnels and a half gallery all created a structural masterpiece that can still be admired to this day.\n\nIf you’d rather experience the Chluse Gorge on foot, then take the lovely hiking route from Kandersteg, past the Kanderfällen waterfalls to Gasterntal Valley, a wild mountain valley formed by a glacier. Along the way you'll pass by the idyllic wetlands surrounded by the Alpine wilderness. Gasterntal Valley is the ideal starting point for lovely mountain hikes and tours.\n\nGetting there: By car or train to Kandersteg.",

It is best to enter at the bottom and explore the gorge starting from there and working your way up. This way is safer and offers the best viewing points. This excursion can also be easily combined with a visit to the Pochtenkessel. This is where the waters of the Engstlige and Otterebach Rivers flow together into a deep hollowed out natural cauldron. And to end your day, why not take a rejuvenating dip in the Jungbrunnen (fountain of youth) pool right below the gorge?\n\nGetting there: By public transport or car to Adelboden.",

The very courageous can undertake a climbing adventure on the Chälistein, directly next to the falls, in the capable hands of a qualified and experienced mountain guide from the Alpine School Adelboden.\nAlso well worth a visit are the Lohner and Bütschi waterfalls\n\n\n\nWalking time:\nEngstligen - waterfalls 1 hr 30 min.\nUnter dem Birg - Engstligenalp 1 hr. 30 min.\nCircular trail from Unter dem Birg 45 min.\nVillage - Lohner falls 1 hr. 15 min.\nVillage - Bütschi falls 1 hr. 30 min.\n\nMore information [http://www.engstligenalp.ch]",

Such technical wonders as reverse tunnels near Kandergrund and reverse galleries near Mitholz are clarified. Other signs divulge information about the electrification of the train, the car train, the rail lines, and the time it took to construct this technical marvel.\nThe hiking path has been installed in such a manner that one gets prime views of the train installations, the Kander Valley, and the lakes Blausee and Riegelsee.

The first section is difficult; the traverse is technically undemanding, but very exposed; \"Grand Mur\" is very difficult and demanding.\n\nStarting-point\nEvolène (1,371m) in the Val d'Hérens, post-bus from Sion; parking is possible on the bypass.\n\nClimb\nComing out of the village, heading for Les Haudères, there is a large sign pointing to the via ferrata. Go up at the edge of the meadow, and it is a short walk through the woods to the foot of the rock wall (the starting point). The route begins off with a small overhang, which gives a hint of the challenges ahead. It then becomes very steep, coming close to perpendicular as it goes up through the compact rock, before bearing left to the ladder which can already be seen from the starting point. The ladder leads on to a fork: the right is the exit route, whilst to the left the via ferrata continues via ledges onto a steep rock wall outcrop with practically no holds. The crossing here is very airy, but is very safe and takes you via a narrow ledge to the entrance to the \"Grand Mur\" [\"Big Wall\"], where there is a second possible exit point. The tough overhang of the \"Grand Mur\" is the first challenge, and then the climber works his way from stirrup to stirrup, with ever more air beneath his feet, and largely without coming into contact with the rock. Moving up the vertical and in places slightly overhanging rock, the climber comes out on the edge of the Prés de Villaz. Time to shake out those arms!\n\nDescent\nAcross the meadows (on a marked path) with excellent views of the extensive mountainous backdrop of the Val d'Héren, down to the first via ferrata exit point, and then zigzagging down to the road. The second via ferrata exit point leads directly down to Evolène. \n\n[http://img.myswitzerland.com/gad/12879/images/k_buch.jpg]Quelle:\nEugen E. Hüsler/Daniel Anker: Wandern vertikal.

Every weekend from April to November, a different winemaker opens its doors to the public, starting at 11am. www.buendnerweine.ch [http://www.buendnerweine.ch]\nASTONISHING VARIETY, SURPRISING SPECIALITIES\nMore than 50 grape varieties are cultivated in Switzerland, tempting wine lovers to explore and discover them. To the Valais, to taste the Petite Arvine and Amigne (white), the Humagne rouge and Cornalin (red); to the shores of Lake Geneva, for the rare red Petit Robert; to Lake Zürich, for the white Räuschling; or to the Bündner Herrschaft, where – alongside a magnificent Pinot noir – the age-old Completer grows. You are sure to come across the Chasselas, the main grape of Western Switzerland, as well as the Merlot of Ticino, and maybe even the new Swiss varieties, Garanoir and Diolinoir.",
    "abstract": "The caress of the wine. “It’s a pity that you cannot caress the wines,” said the satirist Kurt Tucholsky. He was a great wine lover, as so many Swiss are. It’s a great pleasure to stroll through a vineyard when the vines are budding, or when the grapes are ripening; or to visit winemakers and taste their proudest creations. The largest winegrowing areas are in Western Switzerland, on the shores of Lakes Geneva, Neuchâtel, Biel and Murten, and along the valley of the Rhone in the Valais, Switzerland’s most richly varied winegrowing canton. The Valais is home to the highest commercial vineyards in Europe, but some excellent wines flourish in Eastern Switzerland and Graubünden as well. You may not be able to caress Swiss wines, but they will certainly caress your palate.",

In the evening, lighting elements which hang above the square like floating boulders light the scene and draw the young and young at heart into their light.",

Its soft and white inner core is composed of veal meat and some pork bacon. As well as milk. In St. Gallen they are traditionally eaten without mustard, because this covers the nuances of the exquisite meat. At parties, football matches and as streetfood, you can enjoy the golden-brown sausage from the grill together with a crispy St. Gallen Bürli. Gourmets order the sausage flawlessly white from the brew to savour and passionately discuss the compositions of their favourite butchers with all their nuances.",

It is the local recreation area for the city inhabitants and part of a connecting nature protection area that runs along the entire southern slope of the city. \n\nThere are still four ponds remaining from the original five. They were dug out, or filled in as the case may be, in the period between the 17th and 20th centuries and served to provide water to put out fires during blazes and also as a water supply for the city bleaching. With the aid of a wangler, the water was pushed over the Mülegg weir into the Steinach and directed onwards into the city. \n\nThe ponds are beloved swimming areas for the locals in summer and are a meeting point in winter for lovers of ice skating. A round trip through the pond landscape is attractive at any time of the year due to the panoramic view over the entire city.",
    "abstract": "Drei Weieren (Three Ponds) are an oasis of peace in the middle of the city. The ponds, which were originally built by the monastery for their water needs with their art nouveau bath houses, are a popular destination for outings and as swimming spot.",

When snow conditions and the weather are good, the trails are regularly groomed for classic and skating style cross-country skiing. \n\nThe natural ice rink on the Buebenweiher, the middle one of the famous Three Ponds, is a very special experience. When the ice is thick enough, the pond becomes a paradise for skaters of all ages. \n\nThose who prefer skating on artificial ice, will be delighted with the rink at the Lerchenfeld Ice Sports Centre. The ice rink there is open from September to April.",

The Signal cable car from St. Moritz Bad also takes you in the direction of Corviglia. Another cable car then takes summiteers even closer to heaven and the Piz Nair upper station at exactly 3,056 metres above sea level. Without breaking a sweat or exerting yourself, you can enjoy an unforgettable view of St. Moritz, the Upper Engadin lake region and the mountains.\n\nThe summit falls away steeply on all sides, but with a sturdy pair of boots you can tackle the descent via the picturesque Lej Suvretta or into Valetta Schlattain. Mountain bikers love the descent of Alp Suvretta back to St. Moritz, with an altitude difference of 1,200 metres.\n\nThe “Clean Energy Tour [http://www.clean-energy.ch/fileadmin/user_upload_cleanenergy/user_upload/pdf/Clean_Energy_Tour_Flyer.pdf]” between Piz Nair and St. Moritz provides an extensive presentation of the “Energy from Water, Sun, Wind and Biomass” project.\n\nAltitude: 3,022 metres \nHow to get there: Train from Chur to St. Moritz, funicular railways to Chantarella/Corviglia, cable car to Piz Nair \nViews: Towards Muottas Muragl, the Piz Palü and Bernina region, Corvatsch, the Bregaglia Alps, Italy’s Monte Disgrazia in the distance; to the west and north lie Piz Julier, Piz Ela and Piz Kesch \nAttractions: View from the second-highest mountain in the Upper Engadin accessible by cable car; long bike descents \nFood and drink: Panorama restaurant on Piz Nair, restaurants in Corviglia and Lej da la Pêsch \nAccommodation: None on the summit \nGroups: In the panorama restaurant by arrangement \nWinter: Winter sports area of St. Moritz / Upper Engadin \nSpecial comments: The 60-year-old bronze ibex, “Guardiaun Grischun” is the symbol of Piz Nair.",

    "description": "This is a classic glacier traverse in an impressive world of glaciers and should only be done in the company of a mountain guide. The tour starts at the mountain station of the Diavolezza cable car at 2973 m. Across the glacier, past the rocky knoll of the lost island \"Isla Persa\" and the wide arm of the Morteratsch Glacier, you reach a side moraine and finally the Boval Hut. Piz Bernina (4049 m) and Piz Palü, covered by glaciers, create a spectacular backdrop. Along the side moraine, the trail continues to the mouth of the glacier and leads through its forefield to the Morteratsch train station. \n\nTraversing the glacier is recommended only with a mountain guide. Children over the age of 8 are welcome. Good equipment is required, preferably mountain or hiking books with profiled rubber soles. Physical fitness and surefootedness are necessary for this tour. The hiking time is approximately 5 hours. This tour is not suitable for dogs. \n\nHow to get there:\nDrive or take public transportation from St. Moritz/ Pontresina to Bernina-Diavolezza, to Diavolezza by aerial cable-car. \n\nDiavolezza viewing platform \nSituated directly above the Pers Glacier, its form matching that of the glacier moraine, the platform perfectly fits the scenery. In addition to the spectacular views, the visitors might also hear the story of how the Morteratsch Glacier was named – the legend of the beautiful she-devil. The traverse of the Morteratsch Glacier and the Diavolezza viewing platform are both part of the UNESCO world natural heritage and therefore offer something for either target group. Also, the Bernina Glacier app provides an exciting experience in the fantastic scenery.\nFor additional information about the guided Diavolezza-Morteratsch glacier tour of the Pontresina mountaineering school click here",

Discover the attraction of Switzerland’s oldest town, Chur –before moving on via Churwalden to Valbella and more spectacular sights, along with sweeping views over the Lenzerheide. The Seilpark on the Alp Pradaschier, with the world’s longest sled run, is of course yet another spectacular sight. (PostBus stop Churwalden, Post: Sesselbahn Pradaschier). \n\nLenzerheide, too, offers active year-round fun; with the idyllic Heidsee lake that invites visitors to take a refreshing summer plunge; and Globi hiking trail that appeals to children and those young at heart! (PostBus stop Lenzerheide Post). The Lenz sun-terrace offers delightful views over the Albulatal valley and, from this point, the Parc Ela nature reserve extends all the way to Bivio. \n\nOne of many recommended proposals, is a hike from Savognin (PostBus stop Savognin Posta) over the Alp Flix to one of the numerous PostBus stops that lie along this stretch i.e. PostBus stops Rona; Sur –and in summer there’s also an Alpin Bus connection with Alp Flix, leading to Marmorera, Dorf; Bivio, Posta. Bivio is door to the Julier Pass, where the European Rhein-Donau watershed flows, and location of the mountain-bike route over the Septimer Pass (PostBus stop Bivio, Posta). Following Silvaplana, with its unique lake-studded plateau, you find yourself in St. Moritz and the realm of excellent hotels and exclusive shopping possibilities….and that’s not all! Here visitors also delight in the spectacle of horse racing on the region’s deep frozen lake, along with the regal polo snow sport, and the world’s one and only natural bob ice-run that all in all make the beautiful resort a Mecca for winter sport enthusiasts. \nAdditional useful information on the PostBus excursion routes and a wealth of pictures and video clips can be found at the link in the right-hand box.",

Although modernised on many occasions, it has essentially remained the same to this day – just like the view of the Upper Engadine lakeland including St. Moritz, the Piz Palü and the Piz Bernina with its white Biancograt ridge. \n\nHere you can hike into panoramic views in the literal sense: over to Alp Languard (Pontresina) or up to the Segantini hut and the Schafberg, where the artist Giovanni Segantini died a lonely death. Especially enjoyable are the panoramic views from the large sun terrace of the romantic mountain hotel - and sunsets as seen from here are truly remarkable. The train runs until late at night - but you can also take a room at the attractive hotel. \n\nA funicular railway takes over the 700-meter climb from Punt Muragl up to the Muottas Muragl for all scenic lovers – accompanied in the upper section by sun collectors that cover the energy requirements of the mountain dwelling in an environmentally friendly way. In winter, Muottas Muragl is now a playground for sledgers, snowshoe hikers and connoisseurs.

After having become very popular in the snow and sand deserts of the USA, especially in Alaska and New Mexico, these bikes are at the moment conquering Switzerland as well. \n\nHere's a list of destinations which offer fatbiking: \n\nBernese Oberland\n * Gstaad & Zweisimmen: Fatbiking Region Gstaad [https://www.gstaad.ch/en/winter/outdoor/winterbike.html]\n\nGraubünden\n * Davos Klosters: Fatbiking Davos [https://www.davos.ch/en/activities/snowsports/fatbiking-on-pischa]\n * St.Moritz: Fatbiking St.Moritz [https://www.engadin.ch/en/activities/-115348/]\n\nLucerne – Lake Lucerne Region\n * Andermatt: Fatbiking Andermatt [https://www.andermatt.ch/event/gaesteprogramm-fatbike-adventure-by-night-97cd926c5a]\n * Melchsee-Frutt: Fatbiking Melchsee-Frutt [http://www.melchsee-frutt.ch/en/summer/scooter-and-bike-riding/fatbike-plausch/]\n\nValais * Obergoms: Fatbiking Obergoms [https://www.goms.ch/en/fatbike]\n * Zermatt: Fatbike Night-Ride [https://www.zermatt.ch/en/Media/Tickets/Fatbike-Night-Ride]\n\nLake Geneva Region:\n\n * Villars: Fakebike Bretaye-Villars Track [https://www.villars-diablerets.ch/en/V1297/bretaye-villars-track?group=5]",
    "abstract": "Biking is no longer only possible during the warm seasons. Winter has been taken over by the new trend «fatbiking», which offers great training opportunities for active people as well as leisurely rides for pleasure seekers. The over-sized tires make riding on snow a safe and fun adventure.",

The legendary Heinrich Gretler as Alpöhi (Alpine grandfather) remains unforgettable. If you want to visit his cabin, travel to St. Moritz and hike from there to the Salastrains area. At the end of your hike you can sit on the small wooden bench in front of the hut. Or lower your head and glance into the dark interior of the simple wooden house.",
