    "description": "It feels like being in another time as you walk through the majestic palace, pause by the pool in the atrium, climb the huge stone staircase and stroll through the magnificent galleries. The Palais de Rumine is a window on the past – and worth visiting just for the architecture: with its Florentine Renaissance style and grand proportions, it dominates the Place de la Riponne on the western edge of the Old Town. Until 1970 it served as the main building of Lausanne University, and now houses five museums including the renowned Musée cantonal des Beaux-Arts. The art museum holds the largest collection by the Vaud artist, Félix Vallotton.\n\nThe palace was named after Gabriel Rumine, a civil engineer of Russian origin who was born in Lausanne. He died in 1871 at the age of just 30, bequeathing 1.5 million Swiss francs to the city. As luck would have it, the gift coincided with plans to expand the Lausanne Academy into a fully-fledged university with a respectable headquarters. Opened in 1906, the building became a historic location 17 years later: it was here that the Treaty of Lausanne was signed, establishing among other things the present-day borders of Turkey and Greece.",

In so doing, he keeps alive a tradition that stretches back more than 600 years – to the Middle Ages, when his predecessors played the all-important role of raising the alarm when fire broke out in the city.\n\nThis spectacle lasts twenty minutes and can be seen from some bridges and squares in the town, since the tower is illuminated especially for this purpose.\n\nMore information [https://www.lausanne-tourisme.ch/en/explore/lausanne-cathedral/]",

    "name": "Kandersteg-Allmenalp via ferrata",
    "city": "kandersteg",
    "description": "A via ferrata in stunning countryside, along a 350-metre high wall, arranged in a series of columns and gorges, over which - and through which - the Allmibach flows, creating four waterfalls. For 20 years, paragliders have found promising thermals above this wall, which gets the full benefit of the morning sun. Since summer 2005, via ferrata climbers too have been making the climb, at a point not far from the northern end of the Lötschbergtunnel, to reach a cleverly laid-out via ferrata with a number of surprises in store. It is a route which does not artificially seek out the vertical, but does not shy away from it either. The Köppel brothers (who helped to design the Leukerbad via ferrata, the longest and most demanding in Switzerland) worked on the Kandersteg-Allmenalp via ferrata. As a result, the northern and southern ends of the Gemmi Pass, with its various climbs dating from the 18th century which can still evoke fear today, have modern iron ways for mountain sports enthusiasts who deliberately seek out the sensation of vertigo, and with safety in mind. \n\n\nDifficulty\nK4; the key to the climb is the vertical wall shortly after the start, with the most spectacular passage being the route below and above the roof overhang. Two three-rope bridges, each around 30 metres in length, cross the Allmibach; instead of using the upper bridge, there is also the option of using a Tyrolienne traverse to skim over the water. Two more Tyrolienne traverses are planned, leading from the via ferrata off to the right, to the rocky head and then back down to the climb. These should guarantee even more of that adrenalin buzz. The Kandersteg-Allmenalp via ferrata is open from the start of June to mid-October, when the Allmenalp cable-car is running. Warning: construction is during June 2005; official opening on July 30, 2005.\n\nStarting-point\nKandersteg rail station (1,176 m) or Allmenalp-Luftseilbahn valley station (1,181 m) to the south-west of the village.\n\nWalk-in\nFrom Kandersteg rail station, take the hiking route into the valley. Where the Allmibach flows into the river Kander, turn right and to the north of the stream, reaching the start of the via ferrata at roughly 1,250 m. From the Allmenalp-Luftseilbahn valley station, cross farmland and a private bridge over the stream to join the route already mentioned.\n\nRoute\nClimb, keeping to the left, along a 100-metre high wall, vertical in places. Cross a three-rope bridge over the Allmibach. A grassed slope leads to a step, with a roof which projects over it by 10 metres and which is conquered using a unique piece of design (a suspended walkway and a ladder which turns through 180 degrees). To the left of the second-lowest waterfall, the climb rises to an edge, behind which the Allmibach roars and falls. A second three-rope bridge crosses it again - brave via ferrata climbers naturally elect for the option further up, involving travel along a 40-metre long suspended rope. To finish, there is a final wall to the exit point, at around 1,600 m. It is a 20-minute walk up to the Undere Allme (1,723 m) with the mountain station of the Allmenalpbahn and the \"Beiz-\" (inn). \n\nDescent\nBy cable-car. Alternatively, on foot via Ryharts and Schneitböde in 1 _ hours. Alternatively, take a tandem paraglider flight!\n\n[http://img.myswitzerland.com/gad/12879/images/k_buch.jpg] Quelle:\nEugen E. Hüsler/Daniel Anker: Wandern vertikal.

    "city": "kandersteg",
    "description": "During the Middle Ages, the Gemmi Pass was one of the most important links for goods and people travelling between the Bernese Oberland and Valais. These days, the mule track across the Alpine plateau is an exciting hiking trail – even in winter. The cable car from Kandersteg to Sunnbüel covers the first 700 metres of ascent in just 10 minutes. Here, at the tree line, at 1,200 metres above sea level, the four-hour winter hike begins. It passes through the broad basin of the Spittelmatte and, in a short ascent taking about 30 minutes, climbs to the Schwarenbach mountain hotel. \n\nOriginally built as a customs post in 1742, this establishment has hosted celebrated figures such as Mark Twain, Lenin and Pablo Picasso. Even the exterior of the Schwarenbach is impressive, bringing history to life. After some light refreshments, continue up the sunny side of the valley until a wide area opens up – the frozen, snow-covered Daubensee lake at 2,200 metres above sea level. If you have enough power in your legs you can complete the last 100 metres of the ascent on foot. Alternatively, the 8-person gondola will whisk exhausted hikers up to the Gemmi Pass, the final destination for this route and a spectacular lookout point.\n\nWith a bit of luck, you might even spot a bearded vulture flying overhead at the pass. These raptors have re-established themselves here in recent years, and the opportunities to observe them are unrivalled anywhere in Europe.",

One section of this spectacular mountain pass road to the Chluse Gorge had to be dynamited. Masonry parapets, dry stone walls, kerbs, arched bridges, tunnels and a half gallery all created a structural masterpiece that can still be admired to this day.\n\nIf you’d rather experience the Chluse Gorge on foot, then take the lovely hiking route from Kandersteg, past the Kanderfällen waterfalls to Gasterntal Valley, a wild mountain valley formed by a glacier. Along the way you'll pass by the idyllic wetlands surrounded by the Alpine wilderness. Gasterntal Valley is the ideal starting point for lovely mountain hikes and tours.\n\nGetting there: By car or train to Kandersteg.",

It is best to enter at the bottom and explore the gorge starting from there and working your way up. This way is safer and offers the best viewing points. This excursion can also be easily combined with a visit to the Pochtenkessel. This is where the waters of the Engstlige and Otterebach Rivers flow together into a deep hollowed out natural cauldron.

Such technical wonders as reverse tunnels near Kandergrund and reverse galleries near Mitholz are clarified. Other signs divulge information about the electrification of the train, the car train, the rail lines, and the time it took to construct this technical marvel.\nThe hiking path has been installed in such a manner that one gets prime views of the train installations, the Kander Valley, and the lakes Blausee and Riegelsee. Steep stairs enable one to easily gain ground, and picnicking spots make for good trainspotting as one grills one's sausages or steak.",

    "description": " Difficulty\nK3-4/5. The first section is difficult; the traverse is technically undemanding, but very exposed; \"Grand Mur\" is very difficult and demanding.\n\nStarting-point\nEvolène (1,371m) in the Val d'Hérens, post-bus from Sion; parking is possible on the bypass.\n\nClimb\nComing out of the village, heading for Les Haudères, there is a large sign pointing to the via ferrata. Go up at the edge of the meadow, and it is a short walk through the woods to the foot of the rock wall (the starting point). The route begins off with a small overhang, which gives a hint of the challenges ahead. It then becomes very steep, coming close to perpendicular as it goes up through the compact rock, before bearing left to the ladder which can already be seen from the starting point. The ladder leads on to a fork: the right is the exit route, whilst to the left the via ferrata continues via ledges onto a steep rock wall outcrop with practically no holds. The crossing here is very airy, but is very safe and takes you via a narrow ledge to the entrance to the \"Grand Mur\" [\"Big Wall\"], where there is a second possible exit point. The tough overhang of the \"Grand Mur\" is the first challenge, and then the climber works his way from stirrup to stirrup, with ever more air beneath his feet, and largely without coming into contact with the rock. Moving up the vertical and in places slightly overhanging rock, the climber comes out on the edge of the Prés de Villaz. Time to shake out those arms!\n\nDescent\nAcross the meadows (on a marked path) with excellent views of the extensive mountainous backdrop of the Val d'Héren, down to the first via ferrata exit point, and then zigzagging down to the road. The second via ferrata exit point leads directly down to Evolène. \n\n[http://img.myswitzerland.com/gad/12879/images/k_buch.jpg]Quelle:\nEugen E. Hüsler/Daniel Anker: Wandern vertikal.

Every weekend from April to November, a different winemaker opens its doors to the public, starting at 11am. www.buendnerweine.ch [http://www.buendnerweine.ch]\nASTONISHING VARIETY, SURPRISING SPECIALITIES\nMore than 50 grape varieties are cultivated in Switzerland, tempting wine lovers to explore and discover them. To the Valais, to taste the Petite Arvine and Amigne (white), the Humagne rouge and Cornalin (red); to the shores of Lake Geneva, for the rare red Petit Robert; to Lake Zürich, for the white Räuschling; or to the Bündner Herrschaft, where – alongside a magnificent Pinot noir – the age-old Completer grows. You are sure to come across the Chasselas, the main grape of Western Switzerland, as well as the Merlot of Ticino, and maybe even the new Swiss varieties, Garanoir and Diolinoir.",
    "abstract": "The caress of the wine. “It’s a pity that you cannot caress the wines,” said the satirist Kurt Tucholsky. He was a great wine lover, as so many Swiss are. It’s a great pleasure to stroll through a vineyard when the vines are budding, or when the grapes are ripening; or to visit winemakers and taste their proudest creations. The largest winegrowing areas are in Western Switzerland, on the shores of Lakes Geneva, Neuchâtel, Biel and Murten, and along the valley of the Rhone in the Valais, Switzerland’s most richly varied winegrowing canton. The Valais is home to the highest commercial vineyards in Europe, but some excellent wines flourish in Eastern Switzerland and Graubünden as well. You may not be able to caress Swiss wines, but they will certainly caress your palate.",

Its soft and white inner core is composed of veal meat and some pork bacon. As well as milk. In St. Gallen they are traditionally eaten without mustard, because this covers the nuances of the exquisite meat. At parties, football matches and as streetfood, you can enjoy the golden-brown sausage from the grill together with a crispy St. Gallen Bürli. Gourmets order the sausage flawlessly white from the brew to savour and passionately discuss the compositions of their favourite butchers with all their nuances.",

The viewing platform extends up over 50 metres from the ground. From here, visitors can enjoy a sweeping view of the entire Neckertal valley as far as Toggenburger Churfirsten and Appenzellerland. \n\nIf you're craving a light snack, cold and warm dishes are offered in the self-service bistro. Around the treetop path, there are also facilities for active recreation and relaxation. A fitness trail, a log cabin, a forest adventure trail, BBQ areas, idyllic rest areas, a children’s playground and a dreamy natural pond. \n\nTreetop path Neckertal offers wheelchair-friendly parking, with further parking spaces just a 15 to 30-minute walk away. For visitors arriving by public transport, a 40-minute walk leads directly from Mogelsberg train station to Steinwäldli.",

The 500-metre disabled-accessible path gently winds from the forest floor into the treetops – a unique nature experience where visitors are at eye level with the flora and fauna.",

It is the local recreation area for the city inhabitants and part of a connecting nature protection area that runs along the entire southern slope of the city. \n\nThere are still four ponds remaining from the original five. They were dug out, or filled in as the case may be, in the period between the 17th and 20th centuries and served to provide water to put out fires during blazes and also as a water supply for the city bleaching. With the aid of a wangler, the water was pushed over the Mülegg weir into the Steinach and directed onwards into the city. \n\nThe ponds are beloved swimming areas for the locals in summer and are a meeting point in winter for lovers of ice skating. A round trip through the pond landscape is attractive at any time of the year due to the panoramic view over the entire city.",

When snow conditions and the weather are good, the trails are regularly groomed for classic and skating style cross-country skiing. \n\nThe natural ice rink on the Buebenweiher, the middle one of the famous Three Ponds, is a very special experience. When the ice is thick enough, the pond becomes a paradise for skaters of all ages. \n\nThose who prefer skating on artificial ice, will be delighted with the rink at the Lerchenfeld Ice Sports Centre. The ice rink there is open from September to April.",

The tour starts at the mountain station of the Diavolezza cable car at 2973 m. Across the glacier, past the rocky knoll of the lost island \"Isla Persa\" and the wide arm of the Morteratsch Glacier, you reach a side moraine and finally the Boval Hut. Piz Bernina (4049 m) and Piz Palü, covered by glaciers, create a spectacular backdrop. Along the side moraine, the trail continues to the mouth of the glacier and leads through its forefield to the Morteratsch train station. \n\nTraversing the glacier is recommended only with a mountain guide. Children over the age of 8 are welcome. Good equipment is required, preferably mountain or hiking books with profiled rubber soles. Physical fitness and surefootedness are necessary for this tour. The hiking time is approximately 5 hours. This tour is not suitable for dogs. \n\nHow to get there:\nDrive or take public transportation from St. Moritz/ Pontresina to Bernina-Diavolezza, to Diavolezza by aerial cable-car. \n\nDiavolezza viewing platform \nSituated directly above the Pers Glacier, its form matching that of the glacier moraine, the platform perfectly fits the scenery. In addition to the spectacular views, the visitors might also hear the story of how the Morteratsch Glacier was named – the legend of the beautiful she-devil. The traverse of the Morteratsch Glacier and the Diavolezza viewing platform are both part of the UNESCO world natural heritage and therefore offer something for either target group. Also, the Bernina Glacier app provides an exciting experience in the fantastic scenery.\nFor additional information about the guided Diavolezza-Morteratsch glacier tour of the Pontresina mountaineering school click here",

Discover the attraction of Switzerland’s oldest town, Chur –before moving on via Churwalden to Valbella and more spectacular sights, along with sweeping views over the Lenzerheide. The Seilpark on the Alp Pradaschier, with the world’s longest sled run, is of course yet another spectacular sight. (PostBus stop Churwalden, Post: Sesselbahn Pradaschier). \n\nLenzerheide, too, offers active year-round fun; with the idyllic Heidsee lake that invites visitors to take a refreshing summer plunge; and Globi hiking trail that appeals to children and those young at heart! (PostBus stop Lenzerheide Post). The Lenz sun-terrace offers delightful views over the Albulatal valley and, from this point, the Parc Ela nature reserve extends all the way to Bivio. \n\nOne of many recommended proposals, is a hike from Savognin (PostBus stop Savognin Posta) over the Alp Flix to one of the numerous PostBus stops that lie along this stretch i.e. PostBus stops Rona; Sur –and in summer there’s also an Alpin Bus connection with Alp Flix, leading to Marmorera, Dorf; Bivio, Posta. Bivio is door to the Julier Pass, where the European Rhein-Donau watershed flows, and location of the mountain-bike route over the Septimer Pass (PostBus stop Bivio, Posta). Following Silvaplana, with its unique lake-studded plateau, you find yourself in St. Moritz and the realm of excellent hotels and exclusive shopping possibilities….and that’s not all! Here visitors also delight in the spectacle of horse racing on the region’s deep frozen lake, along with the regal polo snow sport, and the world’s one and only natural bob ice-run that all in all make the beautiful resort a Mecca for winter sport enthusiasts. \nAdditional useful information on the PostBus excursion routes and a wealth of pictures and video clips can be found at the link in the right-hand box.",

Although modernised on many occasions, it has essentially remained the same to this day – just like the view of the Upper Engadine lakeland including St. Moritz, the Piz Palü and the Piz Bernina with its white Biancograt ridge. \n\nHere you can hike into panoramic views in the literal sense: over to Alp Languard (Pontresina) or up to the Segantini hut and the Schafberg, where the artist Giovanni Segantini died a lonely death. Especially enjoyable are the panoramic views from the large sun terrace of the romantic mountain hotel - and sunsets as seen from here are truly remarkable. The train runs until late at night - but you can also take a room at the attractive hotel. \n\nA funicular railway takes over the 700-meter climb from Punt Muragl up to the Muottas Muragl for all scenic lovers – accompanied in the upper section by sun collectors that cover the energy requirements of the mountain dwelling in an environmentally friendly way. In winter, Muottas Muragl is now a playground for sledgers, snowshoe hikers and connoisseurs. In winter, Muottas Muragl is now a playground for sledgers, snowshoe hikers and connoisseurs.\n\nAltitude: 2454m \nAccessibility: \nPunt Muragl station of the RhB railway, in the Samedan / Pontresina / St. Moritz triangle; funicular railway (10 minutes) to Muottas Muragl \nView: Lakelands of upper Engadine, St. Moritz; Piz Palü, Piz Bernina with Biancograt \nAttractions: Hikes to the Segantini hut and Schafberg; climate path \nCulinary aspects: Hotel Romantik: stylish pine and walnut ambiance, aperitifs, lunches and festive candle-light dinners \nOvernight stays: First energy-plus hotel in the Alps: 16 romantic rooms with WC, shower and/or bath as well as costfree Wi-Fi \nGroups: Panorama Restaurant 160, pinewood lounge 24, glass-fronted Restaurant Scatla 50, sun terrace 100 seating places; Villa Lyss, renovated Maiensäss and romantic huts for 15 to 25 people \nWinter: Toboggan-run to the valley station, well prepared philosophy trail, snowshoe hiking path but no skiing operations\nSpecial comments: \"Sine sole sileo\" – the world’s most precise sundial",
    "abstract": "With his keen eye for beautiful landscapes, and unique light conditions, Segantini discovered this special patch of the earth. Between the wide valley of the River Inn and the valley that leads to the Bernina Pass, this is probably the most beautiful vantage point above the lakes of Upper Engadine. Sunsets from here are a sight to behold.",

While the last rays of the sun bathe the Engadin in a golden glow, you will be served traditional dishes of the region. At about 11 p.m., the last cable-car will take you back down to the sea of lights that is the village.",

After having become very popular in the snow and sand deserts of the USA, especially in Alaska and New Mexico, these bikes are at the moment conquering Switzerland as well. \n\nHere's a list of destinations which offer fatbiking: \n\nBernese Oberland\n * Gstaad & Zweisimmen: Fatbiking Region Gstaad [https://www.gstaad.ch/en/winter/outdoor/winterbike.html]\n\nGraubünden\n * Davos Klosters: Fatbiking Davos [https://www.davos.ch/en/activities/snowsports/fatbiking-on-pischa]\n * St.Moritz: Fatbiking St.Moritz [https://www.engadin.ch/en/activities/-115348/]\n\nLucerne – Lake Lucerne Region\n * Andermatt: Fatbiking Andermatt [https://www.andermatt.ch/event/gaesteprogramm-fatbike-adventure-by-night-97cd926c5a]\n * Melchsee-Frutt: Fatbiking Melchsee-Frutt [http://www.melchsee-frutt.ch/en/summer/scooter-and-bike-riding/fatbike-plausch/]\n\nValais * Obergoms: Fatbiking Obergoms [https://www.goms.ch/en/fatbike]\n * Zermatt: Fatbike Night-Ride [https://www.zermatt.ch/en/Media/Tickets/Fatbike-Night-Ride]\n\nLake Geneva Region:\n\n * Villars: Fakebike Bretaye-Villars Track [https://www.villars-diablerets.ch/en/V1297/bretaye-villars-track?group=5]",

The legendary Heinrich Gretler as Alpöhi (Alpine grandfather) remains unforgettable. If you want to visit his cabin, travel to St. Moritz and hike from there to the Salastrains area.
