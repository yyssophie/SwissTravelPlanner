"""
Estimate road travel distances between Swiss cities using the OpenAI API.

This script prompts an LLM to return driving-distance estimates (in kilometres)
for each pair of the ten cities defined in ``CITIES``. Results are collected in
an in-memory dictionary so they can be serialised or integrated elsewhere in
the project.

IMPORTANT: LLM answers are heuristic and should be validated against a routing
API (e.g., Google Maps, Mapbox, OpenRouteService) before relying on them in a
production workflow.
